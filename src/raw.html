# How to read this manual

> [Click here](raw.html) for an LLM-friendly version of this manual. You can simply copy this raw manual into your LLM of choice and ask for guidance if you get stuck.

This is the manual for the `gorder` tool—a command-line (CLI) application, Python package, and Rust crate for calculating lipid order parameters from molecular simulations. Most of the manual focuses on the CLI application.

The contents of this manual are shown in the panel on the left side of the page.

In the **Introduction** section, we discuss [why `gorder` exists](introduction.md) and [what lipid order parameters even are](theory.md). Feel free to skip this section.

In the **Beginner** section, we describe [how to install `gorder`](installation.md) and run basic analyses of [atomistic](aaorder_basics.md), [coarse-grained](cgorder_basics.md), and [united-atom](uaorder_basics.md) systems. If you are only interested in, for example, atomistic systems, you can skip the pages dedicated to coarse-grained and united-atom analyses.

In the **Advanced** section, we discuss various features of `gorder`, such as calculating order parameters [for individual leaflets](leaflets.md), constructing [order parameter maps](ordermaps.md), estimating [analysis errors](errors.md), calculating order parameters [in a specific part of the membrane](geometry.md), and analyzing simulations using [dynamically estimated membrane normals](membrane_normal.md#dynamic-membrane-normal). The individual pages are quite independent, so you can skip directly to the ones you need.

In the **Expert** section, we cover more advanced features of `gorder`, which mostly provide greater control over the analyses. This includes [manual lipid assignment to leaflets](manual_leaflets.md), [manual specification of membrane normals](manual_normals.md), and [ignoring periodic boundary conditions](no_pbc.md). You will most likely not need these features.

In the **APIs** section, we briefly explain how to use `gorder` directly as a [Python package](python_api.md) or a [Rust crate](rust_api.md). These topics also have their own dedicated manuals ([Python](https://ladme.github.io/pygorder-docs/), [Rust](https://docs.rs/gorder/latest/gorder/)). The CLI version of `gorder` is fully featured; you do not need to use the APIs unless you want direct integration with your code.

In the **Meta** section, we discuss the [limitations of `gorder`](limitations.md) (**you should read this page!**), where to [send your feedback](feedback.md), and [how to cite `gorder`](citing.md) if you use it in a scientific project.# What is gorder?

`gorder` is a command-line tool that aims to provide a comprehensive, reliable, simple, and fast way to calculate atomistic, coarse-grained, and united-atom lipid order parameters from Gromacs simulations.

The primary (and possibly naïve) goal of `gorder` is to completely replace the use of [`gmx order`](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/onlinehelp/gmx-order.html). `gmx order` is a tool still widely used in the Gromacs community despite its tedious usage and the fact that it sometimes produces completely [incorrect results](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00643).[^1]

Apart from calculating the order parameters correctly, `gorder` also offers many additional features, such as reporting order parameters for individual C-H bonds, error estimation, leaflet classification, geometric selection, or construction of ordermaps. `gorder` can also calculate order parameters for non-planar membranes such as tubes or vesicles.

> `gorder` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and is also available as a [Python package](python_api.md) and a [Rust crate](rust_api.md). If you want to see the code (or comparison with other programs), visit the [`gorder` GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ladme/gorder).

[^1]: Even [Gromacs developers say](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.1/onlinehelp/gmx-order.html#known-issues) that you should not use `gmx order`.# Installation

Installing the `gorder` tool consists of the following steps:

1. **Install Rust.**
    - Follow [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for your operating system.
    - If you already have Rust installed, you can skip this step. To check, run `rustc --version`. 
    > You need Rust v1.82 or newer to be able to install `gorder`. To update Rust, run `rustup update`.

2. **Install `gorder`.**
    ```bash
    cargo install gorder
    ```

You can verify that the installation was successful by running `gorder --version`. The current version of the `gorder` tool should be displayed in the terminal. If everything went right, you can now call `gorder` from anywhere.

***

## Troubleshooting
Below are some common errors you might encounter when installing `gorder` on Linux. If you are still unable to proceed, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Ladme/gorder/issues) and provide details about the problem. 

> Unfortunately, we **cannot** provide support for installing `gorder` on Windows or macOS, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

### Command not found: `cargo`
If, after installing Rust, you are unable to run `cargo install gorder` and receive an error like `command not found: cargo`, it likely means that `cargo` is not included in your PATH. Try closing and reopening your terminal. 

If this does not help and you are using `bash`, try adding the following line to your `.bashrc` file (typically located in your home directory, `~`): `export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"`. Then restart the terminal again.# Atomistic order parameters

## Preparing the input

Suppose we have a [CHARMM36](https://academiccharmm.org/) membrane composed of POPC, POPE, and POPG lipids.

To calculate atomistic order parameters, we need two Gromacs files:
- A TPR file containing the system structure and topology (`system.tpr`).
- An XTC trajectory file (`md.xtc`) whose frames will be analyzed.

> It is recommended to use TPR and XTC files, but `gorder` also [supports some other file formats](other_input.md).

Next, we create a configuration YAML file that specifies the options for the analysis:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !AAOrder
  heavy_atoms: "@membrane and name r'C3.+|C2.+'"
  hydrogens: "@membrane and element name hydrogen"
output: order.yaml
```

In the configuration YAML file, the analysis type `AAOrder` requires you to specify both `heavy_atoms` and `hydrogens`. `gorder` will then identify all bonds connecting the selected heavy atoms with the selected hydrogen atoms. The order parameters are calculated for all these identified bonds.
  
The atoms are selected using a query language called [GSL](gsl.md). If you are familiar with the query language used in VMD, you'll find the basic syntax of GSL intuitive.

Here:
- `heavy_atoms` are selected using the query `@membrane and name r'C3.+|C2.+'`, which selects all palmitoyl and oleoyl carbons of the membrane lipids.
- `hydrogens` are selected using the query `@membrane and element name hydrogen`.

> `@membrane` is a GSL autodetection macro that selects all atoms of common membrane lipids. `r'C3.+|C2.+'` is a regular expression block, natively supported by GSL.

The results of the analysis will be saved in the `order.yaml` file as $-S_{CH}$ (see [Theory](theory.md)).

## Running the analysis

We save the configuration YAML file, for example, as `analyze.yaml`. Then, we run `gorder` as follows:

```bash
$ gorder analyze.yaml
```

During the analysis, we will see something like this:

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

> Note that the structure from the TPR file is not analyzed. The TPR file is only used to construct the system and obtain its topology.

The results of the analysis are saved in the `order.yaml` file. Here is an excerpt from the file:

        POPG H2Y (36):
          total: 0.2177
```

`gorder` automatically identified three molecule types and all relevant bonds. Order parameters are reported separately for each molecule type: for each bond type of each molecule type and for each heavy atom type of each molecule type. Order parameters for heavy atom types are obtained by averaging the order parameters of their bonds with hydrogens. `average order` corresponds to the average order of all the relevant bonds of the entire system or a single molecule type, respectively.

> The atom types are listed in the **same order as they appear in the input TPR structure**. Note that in some force fields (e.g., CHARMM), the sequence of atoms may be unintuitive (e.g., C32 can appear between C22 and C23, even though they are from *different lipid tails*). Always check the output before plotting the results!
Let's take a closer look at a part of the output YAML file:

```yaml
average order:
  total: 0.1631          # average order calculated for all molecules in the entire membrane
POPE:                    # name of the molecule type
  average_order:
    total: 0.1601        # average order calculated for POPE molecules in the entire membrane
  order parameters:
    POPC C22 (23):       # heavy atom type: residue atom_name (relative_index)
      total: 0.1036      # order parameter of the heavy atom
      bonds:             # bonds of this heavy atom with hydrogens
        POPC H2R (24):   # hydrogen type: residue atom_name (relative_index)
          total: 0.0876  # order parameter of bond with this hydrogen
        POPC H2S (25):   # hydrogen type: residue atom_name (relative_index)
          total: 0.1196  # order parameter of bond with this hydrogen
```

YAML files are easy to read programmatically and not completely human-unreadable. However, `gorder` also provides other output formats (XVG, CSV, human-readable table). See [Output formats](output.md) for more information.

## Using groups from an NDX file

`gorder` also supports using groups from NDX files. Let's suppose our NDX file already contains a group called `TailCarbons`, which specifies all the carbons to use. We no longer need to specify them using the complex regular expression from the previous example and can simply select the group. Our configuration YAML file will look like this:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
index: index.ndx               # name of the NDX file
analysis_type: !AAOrder
  heavy_atoms: "TailCarbons"   # name of a group from NDX file
  hydrogens: "@membrane and element name hydrogen"
output: order.yaml
```

Then, we run the analysis in the same way as before.# Coarse-grained order parameters

## Preparing the input

Suppose we have a [Martini 3](https://cgmartini.nl/) membrane composed of POPC, POPE, and POPG lipids.

To calculate coarse-grained order parameters, we need two Gromacs files:
- A TPR file containing the system structure and topology (`system.tpr`).
- An XTC trajectory file (`md.xtc`) whose frames will be analyzed.

> It is recommended to use TPR and XTC files, but `gorder` also [supports some other file formats](other_input.md).

Next, we create a configuration YAML file that specifies the options for the analysis:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "@membrane"
output: order.yaml
```

In the configuration YAML file, the analysis type `CGOrder` requires you to specify beads that will be considered for the analysis. `gorder` will then identify all bonds connecting the selected beads. The order parameters are calculated for all these identified bonds.

The atoms are selected using a query language called [GSL](gsl.md). If you are familiar with the query language used in VMD, you'll find the basic syntax of GSL intuitive.

Here `beads` are selected using the query `@membrane`. That is a GSL autodetection macro that select all beads or atoms of common membrane lipids.

The results of the analysis will be saved in the `order.yaml` file as $S$ (see [Theory](theory.md)).

## Running the analysis

We save the configuration YAML file, for example, as `analyze.yaml`. Then, we run `gorder` as follows:

```bash
$ gorder analyze.yaml
```

During the analysis, we will see something like this:

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

> Note that the structure from the TPR file is not analyzed. The TPR file is only used to construct the system and obtain its topology.

The results of the analysis are saved in the `order.yaml` file. Here is an excerpt from the file:

`gorder` automatically identified three molecule types and all relevant bonds. Order parameters are reported for each bond type of each molecule type. `average order` corresponds to the average order of all the relevant bonds of the entire system or a single molecule type, respectively.

> The bond types are listed in the **same order their atoms appear in the input TPR structure**. Note that in some force fields, the sequence of atoms may be unintuitive and bonds from different tails may not be separated. Always check the output before plotting the results!

Let's take a closer look at a part of the output YAML file:

```yaml

  total: 0.2937                   # average order calculated for all molecules in the entire membrane

  average order:
    total: 0.2902                 # average order calculated for POPC molecules in the entire membrane
  order parameters:

      total: -0.1362              # order parameter of this bond
    POPC PO4 (1) - POPC GL1 (2):  # atom types are specified as residue atom_name (relative_index)
      total: 0.585
    POPC GL1 (2) - POPC GL2 (3):
      total: -0.1808

```

YAML files are easy to read programmatically and not completely human-unreadable. However, `gorder` also provides other output formats (XVG, CSV, human-readable table). See [Output formats](output.md) for more information.

## Using groups from an NDX file

`gorder` also supports using groups from NDX files. Let's suppose our NDX file already contains a group called `LipidBeads`, which specifies all the beads to use. We can then simply select the group. Our configuration YAML file will look like this:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
index: index.ndx        # name of the NDX file
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "LipidBeads"   # name of a group from NDX file
output: order.yaml
```

Then, we run the analysis in the same way as before.# United-atom order parameters

## Preparing the input

Suppose we have a membrane composed of POPC Berger lipids.

To calculate united-atom order parameters, we need two Gromacs files:
- A TPR file containing the system structure and topology (`system.tpr`).
- An XTC trajectory file (`md.xtc`) whose frames will be analyzed.

> It is recommended to use TPR and XTC files, but `gorder` also [supports some other file formats](other_input.md).

Next, we create a configuration YAML file that specifies the options for the analysis:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !UAOrder
  # all carbons of the lipid except for carboxyl atoms (C15, C34) and unsatured atoms (C24, C25)
  saturated: "@membrane and element name carbon and not name C15 C34 C24 C25"
  unsaturated: "@membrane and name C24 C25"
output: order.yaml
```

In the configuration YAML file, you must specify which carbons should have their order parameters calculated and whether they are `saturated` or `unsaturated`. `gorder` will automatically construct hydrogens for saturated carbons so that the total number of bonds of each carbon is 4. For example:
- Carbons within the acyl chains (bonded to two other carbons) will be assigned two hydrogens, whose positions are predicted based on the lipid's geometry.
- Methyl carbons at the ends of the acyl chains will have three hydrogens constructed.
- The central carbon of the glycerol will have one hydrogen constructed.

Unsaturated carbons are those with a double bond to another carbon in the acyl chain (and one single bond to another carbon). Only one hydrogen is predicted for such atoms.

In configuration YAML file above, we calculate order parameters for all carbons in POPC lipids (except for the carboxyl atoms C15 and C34, which lack hydrogens and should be explicitly excluded, as explained below). We also specify a double bond between atoms C24 and C25.

> Positions of hydrogens are predicted in exactly the same way as in the `buildH` tool. See the [buildH documentation](https://buildh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms_Hbuilding.html) for more information.

The results of the analysis will be saved in the `order.yaml` file as $-S_{CH}$ (see [Theory](theory.md)).

### Limitations to consider

There are some limitations you should be aware of when calculating united-atom lipid order parameters:
- Order parameters calculated for individual C-H bonds of **methyl** carbons are **not reliable**. Please read the [note on order parameters of methyl groups](#note-on-order-parameters-of-methyl-groups).
- While the calculation of atomistic and coarse-grained order parameters can be performed for all atom types, the calculation of united-atom parameters must be exclusively performed for **carbon atoms**.
- `gorder` does not have access to the multiplicities of covalent bonds (i.e., it cannot automatically distinguish between single and double bonds). This is why you must specify saturated and unsaturated carbons separately, and why **you should exclude carboxyl carbons from the analysis**. A carboxyl carbon has a double bond to oxygen and is *not* bonded to a hydrogen. However, since `gorder` cannot detect the multiplicity of the double bond, it will attempt to add a hydrogen to the carbon if it is included among saturated carbons. Therefore, you should either exclude the carboxyl carbon entirely or include it among unsaturated atoms.
- If you are calculating united-atom order parameters for unnatural or fictional molecules, `gorder` may not work properly. `gorder` only supports standard lipid molecules, where:
  - No carbon atom is bonded to two double bonds simultaneously.
  - No triple bonds are present.
  - Terminal carbons are methyl groups, not methylidenes.
  - Carbon-hydrogen bonds have a length of about 0.109 nm.

## Running the analysis

We save the configuration YAML file, for example, as `analyze.yaml`. Then, we run `gorder` as follows:

```bash
$ gorder analyze.yaml
```

During the analysis, we will see something like this:

The results of the analysis are saved in the `order.yaml` file. Here is an excerpt from the file:

`gorder` automatically identified one molecule type and all relevant bonds. It then predicted the positions of missing hydrogens for the individual carbons. Order parameters are reported for each carbon of each molecule type, as well as for each predicted C-H bond. `average_order` corresponds to the average order of all the relevant atoms of the entire system or a single molecule type, respectively.

> The atom types are listed in the **same order as they appear in the input TPR structure**. Note that in some force fields, the sequence of atoms may be unintuitive and atoms from different tails may not be separated. Always check the output before plotting the results!

Let's take a closer look at a part of the output YAML file:

```yaml
average order:
  total: 0.098         # average order calculated for all molecules in the entire membrane
POPC:                  # name of the molecule type
  average order:
    total: 0.098       # average order calculated for POPC molecules in the entire membrane
  order parameters:
    POPC C1 (0):       # carbon type: residue atom_name (relative_index)
      total: 0.0001    # order parameter of the carbon
      bonds:           # bonds of this heavy atom with predicted hydrogens
      - total: 0.0001  # order parameter of C-H bond number 1 (predicted hydrogens have no names)
      - total: -0.002  # order parameter of C-H bond number 2
      - total: 0.0021  # order parameter of C-H bond number 3
```

YAML files are easy to read programmatically and not completely human-unreadable. However, `gorder` also provides other output formats (XVG, CSV, human-readable table). See [Output formats](output.md) for more information.

### Note on order parameters of methyl groups

> **This is important! Please read at least the information in this box.** You should not trust the order parameters reported for individual C-H bonds in methyl groups. In methyl groups, only the order parameter calculated for the entire carbon is reliable.

While `gorder` reports order parameters for individual predicted C-H bonds, you might notice that the order parameters for bonds of methyl carbons are somewhat suspicious. Typically, the individual C-H bonds of the same atom have very similar values, but this is not the case here, where the order parameters might differ significantly. For example:

```yaml
    POPC CA2 (51):
      total: 0.0254
      bonds:
      - total: -0.0381   # suspicious
      - total: 0.0572
      - total: 0.0572
```

This discrepancy is an artifact of the hydrogen-building process. The results for individual C-H bonds of methyl carbons depend on the order of atoms that are used as "helpers". For `gorder`, this means that changing the order of atoms in your topology may yield **completely** different results for bonds in methyl groups, even when analyzing the same (but reordered) trajectory.

However, only the order parameters for individual bonds are affected by this artifact. When averaging the order parameters of the individual bonds, the result remains consistent regardless of the helper atom definitions. Thus, the overall order parameter for the atom (the `total` field in the output YAML file) is reasonable and correct *(to the degree united-atom force fields are accurate)* and can be safely reported.

## Using groups from an NDX file

`gorder` also supports using groups from NDX files. Let's suppose our NDX file already contains groups called `Satured` and `Unsaturated`, which specify all carbons to analyze. We can then simply select the groups. Our configuration YAML file will look like this:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
index: index.ndx             # name of the NDX file
analysis_type: !UAOrder
  saturated: "Saturated"     # name of the NDX group containing saturated carbons
  unsaturated: "Unsaturated" # name of the NDX group containing unsaturated carbons
output: order.yaml
```

Then, we run the analysis in the same way as before.

## Ignoring some atoms

In some cases, such as when calculating united-atom order parameters from an atomistic system or when working with a hybrid AA-UA system, you may want to ignore certain atoms so that they are not considered when calculating bonds, obtaining the number of hydrogens to construct for each carbon, or determining helper atoms for predicting hydrogen positions. To do this, add an `ignore` keyword to the `analysis_type` section of your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !UAOrder
  saturated: "@membrane and name r'C3.+|C2.+' and not name C29 C210 C21 C31"
  unsaturated: "@membrane and name C29 C210"
  ignore: "element name hydrogen"
output: order.yaml
```

The above YAML configuration can be used to calculate united-atom lipid order parameters for the tails of atomistic (CHARMM36) POPx lipids (lipids with a palmitoyl and an oleoyl tail). The explicit hydrogen atoms will be ignored, and new hydrogens will be predicted instead.# Selecting atoms using GSL

To specify and select atoms (or coarse-grained beads) in `gorder`, we use the Groan Selection Language (GSL). Its syntax closely matches that used by VMD and various other analysis tools. GSL additionally supports regular expressions and can reference NDX groups from provided NDX files.

**For complete GSL syntax and usage examples, see our [GSL guide](https://ladme.github.io/gsl-guide/).**# Output formats

The YAML output is always generated by `gorder`, as it contains all the calculated information. See [Atomistic order parameters](aaorder_basics.md), [Coarse-grained order parameters](cgorder_basics.md), or [United-atom order parameters](uaorder_basics.md) for more details about this format. However, `gorder` can also write output in other formats.

## CSV format

CSV format may be useful if you want to work with the results using spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel, or when working with data analysis libraries like Pandas or Polars.

To write the results of the analysis in CSV format, add `output_csv: PATH_TO_OUTPUT` to your configuration YAML file.

Here is an excerpt from a CSV file:

Each line corresponds to one heavy atom type (or one bond type in the case of coarse-grained systems). The first column corresponds to the molecule name, the second to the residue name, the third to the atom name, the fourth to the relative index of the atom type, the fifth to the order parameter calculated for this atom type, and the following columns correspond to the order parameters of the bonds the heavy atom type is involved in.

## Table format

The Table format presents the results of the analysis in a clear, human-readable format.

To write the results of the analysis in Table format, add `output_tab: PATH_TO_OUTPUT` to your configuration YAML file.

Here is an excerpt from a Table file:

```text

Each line corresponds to one heavy atom type (or one bond type in the case of coarse-grained systems). The first column corresponds to the name of the atom type, the second to the order parameter calculated for this atom type, and the following columns correspond to the order parameters of the bond the heavy atom type is involved in. The last line in each molecule type (`AVERAGE`) corresponds to the average order of all the relevant bonds of a single molecule type. The last segment (`All molecule types`) shows average order parameter calculated for the entire system (all the identified molecules).

## XVG format

XVG format may be useful if you want to quickly visualize the results as plots using `xmgrace`.

To write the results of the analysis in XVG format, add `output_xvg: FILE_PATTERN` to your configuration YAML file. One XVG file will be created for each molecule. The name of the molecule will be appended to the end of the file stem. For example, if your file pattern is `order.xvg` and the membrane contains POPC, POPE, and POPG lipid molecules, three XVG files will be generated: `order_POPC.xvg`, `order_POPE.xvg`, and `order_POPG.xvg`.

Here is an excerpt from an XVG file:

```text
# Order parameters calculated with 'gorder v1.1.0' using a structure file 'system.tpr' and a trajectory file 'md.xtc'.
@    title "Atomistic order parameters for molecule type POPC"
@    xaxis label "Atom"
@    yaxis label "-Sch"
@    s0 legend "Full membrane"
@TYPE xy
# Atom C22:

# Atom C32:

# Atom C27:
7      0.2031
# Atom C28:
8      0.1196
(...)
```

XVG files provide the least complete information. The first column is the index of the analyzed heavy atom type (starting from 1), and the second column is the order parameter of the atom type.

## Example of a configuration YAML file with all supported outputs requested

  heavy_atoms: "@membrane and name r'C3.+|C2.+'"
  hydrogens: "@membrane and element name hydrogen"

```# Order parameters for individual leaflets

`gorder` can calculate order parameters for the entire membrane as well as for the individual leaflets. 

To do this, you need to specify a method for classifying lipids into membrane leaflets. By default, `gorder` assigns lipids to membrane leaflets independently for each analyzed frame (this can be customized, see [Classification frequency](#classification-frequency)), making it suitable even for the analysis of membranes where lipids flip-flop between leaflets.

There are four leaflet classification methods available in `gorder`: `global`, `local`, `individual`, and `clustering`. In case you are not satisfied with any of them, you can also [assign lipids into leaflets manually](manual_leaflets.md).

> When calculating order parameters for vesicles or similar highly curved membranes, **you should always assign lipids using the [`clustering` method](#clustering-method-for-leaflet-classification) or [manually](manual_leaflets.md)**.

## Global method for leaflet classification

> Reliable for planar membranes and fast. Recommended for most membranes.

In this method, lipid molecules are assigned to membrane leaflets based on the position of their 'head identifier' relative to the **global** membrane center of geometry. The 'head identifier' is a single atom representing the head of the lipid. If the 'head identifier' is located "above" the membrane center, the lipid is assigned to the upper leaflet; if it is located "below", it is assigned to the lower leaflet.

To use this method, you must specify the 'head identifier' atoms and all atoms that form the membrane. [GSL](gsl.md) is used to define these selections.

```yaml
leaflets: !Global
  membrane: "@membrane" 
  heads: "name P"
```

Here, we use autodetected membrane atoms to calculate the membrane center and select atoms named 'P' (phosphorus atoms of lipids) as head identifiers. **Each analyzed lipid must have exactly one head identifier atom**; otherwise, an error will occur.

## Local method for leaflet classification

> Reliable for planar membranes but slow. Recommended for planar membranes if the `global` and `individual` methods do not work for you.

In this method, lipid molecules are assigned to membrane leaflets based on the position of their 'head identifier' relative to the **local** membrane center of geometry. The local membrane center is calculated using atoms in a cylinder around the 'head identifier'. If the 'head identifier' is located "above" the local center, the lipid is assigned to the upper leaflet; if "below", it is assigned to the lower leaflet.

For this method, you need to specify a selection of head identifiers, all atoms forming the membrane, and the radius of the cylinder used to define the local membrane.

```yaml
leaflets: !Local
  membrane: "@membrane"
  heads: "name P"
  radius: 2.5
```

Autodetected membrane atoms will be used to calculate the membrane center. Only atoms within a cylinder of radius 2.5 nm (with infinite height) centered on the 'head identifier' and oriented along the membrane normal will be used for the local center calculation. The atoms named 'P' (phosphorus atoms of lipids) are used as 'head identifiers'.

## Individual method for leaflet classification

> Less reliable but very fast. Recommended for very large, undulating planar membranes.

In this method, lipid molecules are assigned to membrane leaflets based on the position of their 'head identifier' relative to their 'tail ends'. 'Tail ends' refer to the last heavy atoms or beads of the lipid tails. Each lipid molecule may have multiple 'tail ends', but only one 'head identifier'. If the 'head identifier' is located "above" the 'tail ends', the lipid is assigned to the upper leaflet; if it is located "below", it is assigned to the lower leaflet.

To use this method, you must specify selections for the 'head identifiers' and the 'tail ends':

```yaml
leaflets: !Individual
  heads: "name P"
  methyls: "name C218 C316"
```

In this example, atoms named 'P' (phosphorus atoms of lipids) are used as head identifiers, and 'C218' or 'C316' atoms (the last carbons of oleoyl and palmitoyl chains) are used as tail ends.

## Clustering method for leaflet classification

> Reliable but very slow. Recommended for curved membranes.

This method assigns lipid molecules to membrane leaflets by clustering their head groups using [spectral clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_clustering). This method can handle any membrane geometry that is physically realistic, including curved membranes with pores or lipid flip-flop.

To use the clustering method, specify a selection for 'head identifiers':

```yaml
leaflets: !Clustering
  heads: "name P"
```

In this example, phosphorus atoms ('P') serve as head identifiers. As with other methods, each lipid molecule must have exactly one head identifier, but you can also include head identifiers for lipid molecules for which you are not calculating the order parameters. The method groups the specified atoms into two clusters representing the membrane leaflets.

### Important considerations for the clustering method
- **Upper vs lower leaflet assignment:** Unlike other methods, clustering does not use the membrane normal direction, so the labels `upper` and `lower` leaflets are set somewhat arbitrarily following these rules:
  - First frame: The more populated cluster becomes the `upper` leaflet. If equal, the cluster containing the lowest-index head identifier is `upper`.
  - Subsequent frames: Clusters are matched to previous frame's leaflets based on similarity.
  - The matching is heuristic in membranes with lipid flip-flop and may fail if more than roughly 20% of lipids change leaflets between two consecutive analyzed frames. An error is raised if 20-80% lipids change leaflets. If more than 80% change leaflets, results will be incorrect without warning (though this is extremely unlikely).
  - The matching may also fail if the spectral clustering identifies the leaflets incorrectly. In such case, you should provide the leaflet assignment manually.
- **Head identifier selection:** When using the clustering method, always select head identifiers for **all** lipids in your membrane—even if analyzing only a specific subset of lipids and particularly when this subset resides in just one membrane leaflet.
- **Extremely slow:** Spectral clustering can be extremely slow, especially when your membrane is large. If you know that there is no flip-flop in your system, it is **highly recommended** to set the classification `frequency` to `!Once` when using this method (see [below](#classification-frequency)).

## Classification frequency

By default, `gorder` performs leaflet classification independently for each analyzed frame. This ensures accurate analysis in membranes where lipid exchange occurs between leaflets. However, you can modify this behavior using the `frequency` keyword to specify how often leaflet classification should be performed.

### Once
If you know that lipid flip-flop does not occur in your system and want to accelerate the analysis, you can use `frequency: !Once`. This option assigns lipids to individual membrane leaflets based on the **first** trajectory frame (**not** the TPR file structure), and this assignment is then used for all subsequent trajectory frames.

Example usage:
```yaml
leaflets: !Local
  membrane: "@membrane"
  heads: "name P"
  radius: 2.5
  frequency: !Once
```

> Using `frequency: !Once` is especially useful for the local and clustering classification methods which are computationally expensive.

### Every N frames
Alternatively, you can specify that classification should occur every N analyzed trajectory frames using `frequency: !Every N`. For example, `frequency: !Every 10` means that classification will be performed every 10 analyzed trajectory frames, with the closest previous assignment used for intermediate frames.

Example usage:
```yaml
leaflets: !Global
  membrane: "@membrane"
  heads: "name P"
  frequency: !Every 10
```

> **Important note:** The frequency applies to **analyzed** trajectory frames. For instance, if the classification frequency is set to 10 and the analysis step size is 5 (see [Analyzing a part of the trajectory](timerange.md)), leaflet classification will occur every **50th** (10×5) frame in the input trajectory.

## Membrane normal

All leaflet classification methods (except for the clustering method) use the specified membrane normal to determine what is 'up' and what is 'down'. If your membrane is planar and aligned with the `xy` plane, no further action is needed. Otherwise, refer to [this section of the manual](membrane_normal.md).

Here, we just mention that the membrane normal used for leaflet classification can be decoupled from the 'global' membrane normal used for calculating order parameters:

```yaml
leaflets: !Global
  membrane: "@membrane"
  heads: "name P"
  membrane_normal: x   # used only for leaflet classification
```


## Leaflet-wise output

When a leaflet classification method is defined, `gorder` calculates order parameters for both the entire membrane and individual leaflets. Leaflet-specific order parameters are included in all `gorder` output formats: YAML, CSV, "table", and XVG.

During analysis, `gorder` also prints information about membrane composition in the first trajectory frame, allowing you to quickly check for any obvious errors. Such membrane composition information may look like this:

```text
(...)
[*] Upper leaflet in the first analyzed frame: POPE: 45, POPC: 50, POPG: 5
[*] Lower leaflet in the first analyzed frame: POPE: 45, POPC: 50, POPG: 5
(...)
```

Below is an excerpt from an output YAML file containing results for individual membrane leaflets:

```# Maps of order parameters

## Basic analysis

`gorder` can create maps of order parameters ("ordermaps") for the individual bond types and atom types. To construct an ordermap, the membrane plane is mapped onto a grid with bins of a specified size. Order parameters calculated for individual bonds are projected into the respective bins based on the position of the bond center. The average order parameter is then computed for each bin in the grid.

To enable the calculation of ordermaps, add the following section to your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
ordermaps:
  output_directory: "ordermaps"
```

`gorder` will generate one ordermap per bond type and save it in the `ordermaps` directory. If you calculate atomistic order parameters, ordermaps for individual heavy atom types will also be created as averages of the order parameters of heavy atom - hydrogen bonds. An ordermap with the average order parameter collected from all relevant bonds will also be written for each molecule type as well as for the entire system. If the calculation of order parameters for the individual membrane leaflets is requested (see [Order parameters for individual leaflets](leaflets.md)), additional ordermaps for the upper and lower leaflets will be constructed.

If the output directory (here `ordermaps`) does not exist, it will be created. If it already exists, it will be backed up unless the [`overwrite`](other_options.md#overwrite) option is enabled.

By default:
- The ordermap is placed in the plane perpendicular to the membrane normal (usually the xy-plane since the membrane normal is typically along the z-axis).
- The dimensions of the ordermaps are derived from the simulation box dimensions in the input **structure** file.
- The bin size is set to 0.1×0.1 nm.
- At least one sample per bin is required to calculate the order parameter for that bin.

You can manually override these default settings, see below.

## Options for ordermaps

### Plane of the ordermaps

To specify the plane for constructing the ordermaps, use the `plane` option:

```yaml
ordermaps:
  output_directory: "ordermaps"
  plane: xz
```

The ordermaps will be created in the xz plane. For the xz plane, the first dimension corresponds to the x-axis and the second to the z-axis. For the yz plane, the first dimension corresponds to the z-axis and the second to the y-axis.

### Dimensions of the ordermaps

To define the size (span) of the ordermaps, use the `dim` option:

```yaml
ordermaps:
  output_directory: "ordermaps"
  dim:
    - !Manual { start: 5.0, end: 10.0 }
    - !Auto
```

In this example, the ordermaps are placed in the xy plane. They will cover an area spanning 5–10 nm along the x-axis, while the size along the y-axis will be automatically set based on the simulation box size.

### Size of the bins

To set the bin size (granularity of the ordermaps), use the `bin_size` option:

```yaml
ordermaps:
  output_directory: "ordermaps"
  bin_size: [0.05, 0.2]
```

Here, the bins are 0.05 nm wide along the x-axis and 0.2 nm wide along the y-axis.

### Required number of samples

To specify the required number of samples per bin, use the `min_samples` option:

```yaml
ordermaps:
  output_directory: "ordermaps"
  min_samples: 50
```

For this example, at least 50 samples must be collected in a bin to calculate the order parameter for it. If the collected sample count is less than 50, the order parameter for that bin will be recorded as NaN.

## Ordermap format

Ordermaps are saved in a custom two-dimensional `gorder` format:

```text
# Map of average order parameters calculated for the atom type POPC-C22-32.
# Calculated with 'gorder v1.1.0'.

This example ordermap corresponds to the atom type `POPC-C22-32` (C22 of POPC). Lines beginning with `#` are comments, while lines starting with `@` and `$` define plotting parameters. Other lines contain the calculated order parameters. The first column represents the first coordinate of the bin (here x-dimension), the second column represents the second coordinate (here y-dimension), and the third column contains the average order parameter for the bin. The data is stored in row-major order. Note that the order parameter may be NaN; ensure your plotting software can handle such cases.

## Plotting ordermaps

For easy visualization of ordermaps, `gorder` generates a Python script named `plot.py` in the ordermaps directory.

To run the script, it is recommended to use the [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager. To visualize an ordermap, navigate to the generated ordermaps directory and run:

```bash
uv run plot.py INPUT_ORDERMAP
```

Here, `INPUT_ORDERMAP` is the path to the ordermap file you want to plot. A window displaying the generated plot will appear.

If you want to plot and save the ordermap as a PNG file, run:

```bash
uv run plot.py INPUT_ORDERMAP OUTPUT_PNG
```

Here, `OUTPUT_PNG` is the path where the PNG file will be saved.

## Examples of plotted ordermaps

When visualized, an ordermap for a specific atom type might look like this:

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

Ordermaps are especially useful for analyzing simulations involving transmembrane proteins. For such analyses, ensure the protein is centered and, ideally, RMSD-fitted in the trajectory.

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

In this map of coarse-grained order for a particular lipid bond, the bright white region in the center represents the area occupied by the transmembrane protein. In this zone, no lipids (or an insufficient number to meet the `min_samples` threshold of 50) were detected. The membrane is disrupted in the vicinity of the protein.# Estimating errors

`gorder` is able to provide estimates of error for the individual bonds, atoms, and entire molecules.

The primary source of error when calculating order parameters from molecular dynamics simulations is the lack of convergence in the simulation. It’s also important to note that an order parameter calculated from a single trajectory frame is very unreliable unless the system is gigantic and contains many molecules. Using the standard deviation or standard error calculated from order parameters of individual frames or even samples is therefore not a viable option. Instead, `gorder` uses block averaging to calculate an error that reflects how well the simulation has converged.

To estimate the error, the trajectory is divided into blocks (default: 5). Each block represents a sequential portion of the trajectory: for example, the first fifth of the frames make up block #1, the second fifth forms block #2, and so on. The average order for each bond is calculated within each block, and a **sample standard deviation** is calculated from these block averages. This standard deviation is reported as the error. For simulations that are well-converged and have large enough blocks, the standard deviation between the blocks will be small.


## Requesting error estimation

By default, `gorder` does not calculate error estimates. To enable error estimation, include the following line in your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
estimate_error: true
```

The output YAML file will then include error estimates and may look similar to this:

```yaml

```

The errors are also reported in CSV and table files but **not** in XVG files:

> Error estimates are currently **not** available for individual [ordermaps](ordermaps.md).

## Changing the number of blocks

If you are unsatisfied with the default number of blocks (5), you can adjust this parameter:

```yaml
estimate_error:
  n_blocks: 10
```

For example, setting `n_blocks: 10` will use 10 blocks for error estimation instead of the default 5. You should avoid tweaking this number to get a lower error estimate.

## Convergence analysis

`gorder` offers an additional method to assess simulation convergence by visualizing how the average order parameters evolve over time for individual molecules.

To request convergence analysis, include the following lines in your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
estimate_error:
  output_convergence: convergence.xvg
```

This will not only estimate errors as described above but also generate an XVG file (e.g., `convergence.xvg`) which shows the order parameters calculated for each frame as the average of values from that frame and all preceding frames (i.e., prefix averages).

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

The example plot illustrates a relatively well-converged atomistic simulation where approximately 3,000 trajectory frames were analyzed. The chart shows that results for POPE and POPC lipids stabilize early (within the first third of the trajectory), while POPG converges more slowly (which is due to the smaller number of these lipids in the system).# Order parameters for a specific membrane region

`gorder` allows you to calculate order parameters for a specific region of the membrane within a defined geometric shape. Currently, three geometric shapes are supported for this selection: [cuboid](#cuboid-selection), [cylinder](#cylindrical-selection), and [sphere](#spherical-selection). When a geometric shape is specified, only **bonds** located within that shape are included in the order parameter calculations. The bond's inclusion is dynamically evaluated for every frame of the trajectory. This feature is useful for instance when analyzing order parameters near transmembrane proteins or specific membrane regions.

> **Note:** The position of a bond is defined as the center of geometry of the bonded atoms.


## Cuboidal selection

You can define a cuboid with specific dimensions and position to calculate order parameters for bonds within that region. To define a cuboid, include a configuration like the following in your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
geometry: !Cuboid
  x: [2.0, 4.0]
  y: [1.0, 5.0]
  z: [0.0, 3.0]
```

This configuration calculates order parameters for bonds where the x-coordinate is between 2 and 4 nm, the y-coordinate is between 1 and 5 nm, and the z-coordinate is between 0 and 3 nm.

If a dimension is not specified, the cuboid is considered unbounded in that dimension, allowing bonds at any coordinate along that axis:

```yaml
geometry: !Cuboid
  x: [2.0, 4.0]
  y: [1.0, 5.0]
  # the cuboid is infinite along the z-dimension
```

You can also define a `reference` point to make the cuboid dimensions relative instead of absolute:

```yaml
geometry: !Cuboid
  reference: [3.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  x: [-2.0, 2.0]
  y: [1.0, 5.0]
```

In this example, the cuboid extends from 1 to 5 nm along the x-dimension, from 2 to 6 nm along the y-dimension, and remains infinite along the z-dimension. Periodic boundary conditions are also taken into account when constructing the cuboid.

The `reference` point can be defined as a static coordinate, a dynamic center of geometry of a specified group of atoms, or the center of the simulation box. For details, see [Specifying the reference point](#specifying-the-reference-point).

Below is an example of an ordermap where calculations considered only bonds within a specific cuboid. The static center of the cuboid is marked by a black `×`.

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

## Cylindrical selection

You can define a cylinder with specific dimensions, orientation, and position to calculate order parameters for bonds within that region. To specify a cylinder, include a configuration like the following in your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
geometry: !Cylinder
  reference: [3.0, 1.0, 4.0]
  radius: 2.5
  span: [-1.0, 1.0]
  orientation: z
```

This configuration calculates order parameters for bonds within a cylinder centered at x = 3 nm, y = 1 nm, z = 4 nm. The cylinder is oriented along the z-axis, has a radius of 2.5 nm, and a height of 2 nm (spanning from z = 3 nm to z = 5 nm). Periodic boundary conditions are also taken into account when constructing the cylinder.

The reference point for the cylinder can be defined as a static coordinate, a dynamic center of geometry of a specified group of atoms, or the center of the simulation box. If the `reference` value is omitted, the origin of the simulation box `[0, 0, 0]` is used. For more details, see [Specifying the reference point](#specifying-the-reference-point).

If the `span` parameter is omitted, the cylinder is considered infinitely long along its main axis (`orientation`):

```yaml
geometry: !Cylinder
  radius: 2.5
  orientation: z
```

In this case, the cylinder is centered at the origin `[0, 0, 0]`, has a radius of 2.5 nm, is oriented along the z-axis, and has an infinite height.

The main axis of the cylinder (`orientation`) must align with one of the simulation box dimensions. Only `x`, `y`, and `z` orientations are supported.

Below is an example of an ordermap where calculations considered only bonds within a specific cylinder (oriented along the membrane normal). The static center of the cylinder is marked by a black `×`.

IMAGE INTENTIONALLY EXCLUDED

## Spherical selection

You can define a sphere with a specific center and radius to calculate order parameters for bonds within that region. To specify a sphere, include a configuration like the following in your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
geometry: !Sphere
  reference: [3.0, 1.0, 4.0]    # you can also use `center` instead of `reference`
  radius: 2.5
```

This configuration calculates order parameters for bonds within a sphere centered at x = 3 nm, y = 1 nm, z = 4 nm, with a radius of 2.5 nm. Periodic boundary conditions are also considered when constructing the sphere.

The reference point (or center) for the sphere can be defined as a static coordinate, a dynamic center of geometry of a specified group of atoms, or the center of the simulation box. If the `reference` value is omitted, the sphere is centered at the origin of the simulation box `[0, 0, 0]`. For additional details, see [Specifying the reference point](#specifying-the-reference-point).

## Specifying the reference point

The reference point can be specified in one of three ways:

1. **Static coordinates**

Define a fixed reference point using explicit coordinates:

```yaml
reference: [2.0, 2.5, 1.5]
```

This places the reference point at x = 2.0 nm, y = 2.5 nm, and z = 1.5 nm. Note that these coordinates are **not** scaled by the simulation box dimensions.

2. **Dynamic center of geometry of selected atoms**

Set the reference point as the center of geometry of a specified group of atoms:

```yaml
reference: "@protein"
```

Here, the reference point corresponds to the geometric center of the `@protein` atom selection (all protein atoms in the system). The geometric center is recalculated for every frame of the trajectory. Use [GSL](gsl.md) syntax to specify the atom selection.

3. **Dynamic simulation box center**

Choose the center of the simulation box as the reference point:

```yaml
reference: !Center
```

The reference point will be the geometric center of the simulation box in all three dimensions, recalculated for every frame of the trajectory.

> If no reference point is specified, the default is the simulation box origin at `[0, 0, 0]`.# Specifying membrane normal

`gorder` supports both `static` (provided by the user and applied to all lipid molecules throughout the entire analysis) and `dynamic` (calculated for each lipid molecule in each trajectory frame based on the actual membrane shape) membrane normal specification.

For planar membranes, the default static membrane normal is usually sufficient. However, for vesicles, you should always use dynamic membrane normal calculation. Keep in mind that computing the membrane normal dynamically is computationally expensive.

For complete control over membrane normals, you can also manually assign them for each molecule in every trajectory frame. For more details, refer to [Manual membrane normals](manual_normals.md).

## Static membrane normal

By default, `gorder` assumes the membrane normal is oriented along the z-axis, meaning the membrane is built in the xy-plane. If your membrane is oriented differently, you can manually specify the membrane normal in the configuration YAML file:

```yaml
membrane_normal: x
```

In this example, the membrane normal is oriented along the x-axis, which means that the membrane is built in the yz-plane.

> Only the primary axes of an orthogonal simulation box (`x`, `y`, and `z`) are supported as static membrane normals.

## Dynamic membrane normal

If your membrane is non-planar, or if you want to use the actual membrane normal instead of an idealized direction, you can enable dynamic membrane normal calculation. In this case, you must specify the selection of 'head identifier' atoms (similar to when [assigning lipids to leaflets](leaflets.md)):

```yaml
membrane_normal: !Dynamic
  heads: "name P"
```

These 'head identifiers' are used to estimate the membrane surface and calculate the membrane normal for each lipid molecule. For consistency with leaflet classification, **each analyzed lipid molecule must have exactly one head identifier**; otherwise, an error will be raised.

The membrane normal is estimated for each lipid molecule in every frame. This is done by collecting the positions of 'head identifiers' located within a sphere around the molecule’s own head identifier and performing principal component analysis (PCA) on these positions. The last principal component (the direction with the least variation in atom positions) is then used as the membrane normal.

By default, the radius of the 'scanning sphere' is **2 nm**, but you can adjust it in the input file:

```yaml
membrane_normal: !Dynamic
  heads: "name P"
  radius: 1.5
```

The 'scanning sphere' must meet several requirements:  
- It must be large enough to include a sufficient number of lipid heads for reasonable principal component analysis.
- It must be small enough to capture local membrane curvature correctly.
- Most importantly, it must be **small enough to avoid including head identifiers from the opposite membrane leaflet**, as this would distort the calculated membrane normal.

As a general rule of thumb, set the radius to approximately **half of the membrane thickness**.

### Limitations

When using dynamic membrane normal calculation, you should be aware of some limitations:

1. **Ignoring periodic boundary conditions**  
When [ignoring periodic boundary conditions](no_pbc.md), membrane normals for lipids located near the edges (and especially at the corners) of the simulation box might not be calculated accurately. This occurs because, without PBC, not all nearby lipid heads are included in the surface estimation. If periodic boundary conditions are considered (which is the default), this issue does not occur.

2. **Assigning lipids to leaflets**  
All methods for classifying lipids into leaflets use the membrane normal to determine what is 'up' and what is 'down' in the membrane. However, due to technical limitations, these methods cannot use dynamically calculated membrane normals and always require a static membrane normal. You can specify this manually, for example:

    ```yaml
    leaflets: !Global
      membrane: "@membrane" 
      heads: "name P"
      membrane_normal: z
    ```

    This membrane normal definition is used only when assigning lipids into leaflets. If you are working with a (reasonably) planar membrane, the membrane normal for leaflet classification does not need to be precise, so this approach is perfectly fine, even if you are otherwise working with dynamically calculated membrane normals. However, for a curved membrane, such as a vesicle, you should instead use the [clustering method](leaflets.md#clustering-method-for-leaflet-classification) which does not use membrane normals or [assign lipids into leaflets manually](manual_leaflets.md).

3. **Constructing ordermaps**  
When constructing ordermaps, the plane in which an ordermap is generated is determined by the provided membrane normal. Since ordermaps can only be constructed in the `xy`, `xz`, or `yz` plane, they also require a static membrane normal (`z`, `y`, or `x`). If you are calculating the membrane normal dynamically and also want to construct ordermaps, you must specify the ordermap plane manually:

    ```yaml
    ordermaps:
      output_directory: "ordermaps"
      plane: xy
    ```# Analyzing a part of the trajectory

By default, `gorder` analyzes the entire provided trajectory, meaning it processes all frames from the start to the end of the trajectory.

If you want to analyze only a specific part of the trajectory, you can use the `begin`, `end`, and `step` options to control the time range and frequency of analysis.

- `begin`: Specifies the time (in ps) from which the trajectory will start being read.
- `end`: Specifies the time (in ps) at which the trajectory analysis will stop.
- `step`: Specifies the step size for reading trajectory frames (i.e., how often a frame will be analyzed).

### Example: Calculating coarse-grained order parameters from a specific part of a trajectory

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "@membrane"
begin: 100000.0
end: 300000.0
step: 5
output: order.yaml
```

In this example, the analysis starts at time 100,000 ps (100 ns) and ends at time 300,000 ps (300 ns). Every 5th frame of the trajectory will be analyzed.# Providing multiple trajectory files

If the trajectory you are analyzing is split across multiple files, you can provide all of them without having to manually merge them into a single file.

To do this, specify all your trajectory files as a list in your configuration YAML file:
```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: [md1.xtc, md2.xtc, md3.xtc, md4.xtc, md5.xtc]
analysis_type: !AAOrder
  heavy_atoms: "@membrane and name r'C3.+|C2.+'"
  hydrogens: "@membrane and element name hydrogen"
output: order.yaml
```

`gorder` will seamlessly concatenate all the trajectory files and analyze them. If the individual trajectories are from the same simulation and follow each other directly, the last frame of a previous trajectory file will match the first frame of the subsequent file. Don't worry, `gorder` will automatically detect this scenario and consider only one of these frames. In contrast, if the frames have different simulation times, both will be included in the analysis. Note that if other frames in the trajectory share the same simulation time, `gorder` will analyze all of them. The tool only filters out duplicate frames at the boundaries between individual files.

> Trajectory concatenation is supported **only for XTC and TRR** files. All files must be of the same trajectory type; concatenating XTC files with TRR files is not supported.

Alternatively, instead of listing all trajectory files, you can specify them using a glob pattern:
```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md*.xtc
analysis_type: !AAOrder
  heavy_atoms: "@membrane and name r'C3.+|C2.+'"
  hydrogens: "@membrane and element name hydrogen"
output: order.yaml
```

In this case, `gorder` will read all XTC files in the current directory whose names start with `"md"`, such as `md1.xtc`, `md2.xtc`, `md3.xtc`, as well as `mdXYZ.xtc`, `md239474.xtc`, and similar files, if they exist.

> Glob returns files in lexicographic order based on filenames. As a result, `md10.xtc` may appear before `md2.xtc`. Always verify the order of XTC files and ensure that filenames are structured so that lexicographic and numerical ordering align. For example, when dealing with trajectories 1–99, use filenames like `md01.xtc` to `md99.xtc` to maintain the correct order.# Multithreaded analysis

The trajectory analysis can be performed using multiple threads. Utilizing more threads is generally much faster than using just one, although the speed gain also depends on the read performance of your storage device.

By default, `gorder` uses only 1 thread to perform the analysis. If you want to speed up the process by using multiple threads, you can specify the number of threads in your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
n_threads: 4
```

In the example above, the analysis will be performed using 4 threads.

> `gorder` guarantees binary-identical results on the same system and build environment, independent of the number of threads used.# Other options

## Min samples

By default, `gorder` calculates order parameters for all bonds for which it collects at least one sample. If you want to increase the number of required samples, you can specify the minimum number of samples manually in the configuration YAML file:

```yaml
min_samples: 10000
```

In this example, at least 10,000 samples are required for the bond to have a valid order parameter. If the number of samples is lower than this value, the order parameter will be NaN.

## Overwrite

By default, `gorder` does not overwrite output files. Before writing an output file (or creating an output directory for the ordermaps), any existing file (or directory) with the same name is backed up. You can change this behavior by specifying the `overwrite` option in the configuration YAML file:

```yaml
overwrite: true
```

In this example, no backups will be created, and files will be overwritten directly.

You can also specify this option on the command line when calling `gorder`:

```bash
$ gorder INPUT_YAML --overwrite
```

## Silent

By default, gorder writes a lot of information about the progress of the analysis to the terminal (standard output). If you prefer not to see any of this information, you can specify it in the configuration YAML file:

```yaml
silent: true
```

In this example, gorder will not write anything to standard output. Output files will still be generated, and the analysis will proceed as normal. If an error occurs, information about the error will be written to standard error output.

You can also specify this option on the command line when calling `gorder`:

```bash
$ gorder INPUT_YAML --silent
```# Manual lipid assignment to leaflets

If you do not want to use the automatic leaflet classification (described in [Order parameters for individual leaflets](leaflets.md)), whether due to your system's complicated geometry or a lack of trust in the `gorder` assignment, you can manually specify the leaflet occupied by each lipid molecule (for each analyzed frame).

There are two ways to manually assign lipids to membrane leaflets: using [NDX files](leaflets_ndx.md) or a ["leaflet assignment file"](leaflets_assignment_file.md).# Assigning lipids using NDX file(s)

Using NDX files for lipid assignment is arguably a simpler method that enables seamless integration of `gorder` with [`FATSLiM`](https://fatslim.github.io/), which implements one of the better lipid classification methods available.

## NDX file

To begin, create an NDX file containing at least two groups. One group should contain lipid atoms (preferably just their 'head identifiers') of the upper leaflet, while the other group should contain lipid atoms of the lower leaflet. 

```
[ UpperLeaflet ]
1140 1274 1810 2078 2212 2480 2614 2748 2882 3150 3284 3418 3686 3954 4088

[ LowerLeaflet ]

```

## Using the NDX file

Then, specify the classification method in your configuration file:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromNdx
  ndx: "leaflets.ndx"
  heads: "name P"
  upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
  lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
  frequency: !Once
```

The leaflet assignment will be read from the NDX file `leaflets.ndx`, which should contain two groups: `UpperLeaflet` and `LowerLeaflet`. These groups should include the atoms of the upper and lower leaflets, respectively. The `heads` field specifies the head identifiers for all analyzed lipid molecules. Note that each lipid molecule must have only one head identifier; otherwise, an error will be returned. Since we are using a single NDX file, we also need to specify `frequency: !Once`, ensuring that the leaflet assignment from the NDX file is applied to all analyzed trajectory frames.

The `UpperLeaflet` and `LowerLeaflet` groups may contain various atoms, but they **must** include all `heads` atoms for the lipids being analyzed. In other words, every analyzed lipid must be assigned to a leaflet. The NDX file itself can contain any number of additional groups, but for performance reasons, it is recommended to keep both the file and the specified groups as small as possible.

## Scrambling-safe leaflet assignment

Instead of using a single NDX file, you can provide multiple NDX files, such as one file per trajectory frame. Your configuration file may then look like this:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromNdx
#          first frame         second frame        third frame         fourth frame
  ndx: ["leaflets0001.ndx", "leaflets0002.ndx", "leaflets0003.ndx", "leaflets0004.ndx", (...)]
  heads: "name P"
  upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
  lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
```

With this setup, leaflet assignment will be performed for each frame using a different NDX file.

## Specifying NDX files using `glob` pattern

Instead of manually listing many NDX file paths in the configuration file, you can use glob pattern matching:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromNdx
  ndx: "leaflets*.ndx"
  heads: "name P"
  upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
  lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
```

This pattern matches all NDX files in the current directory whose names start with `"leaflets"`, such as `leaflets0001.ndx`, `leaflets0002.ndx`, as well as `leafletsABCD.ndx`, `leafletsX.ndx`, and similar files, if they exist.

> Glob returns files in lexicographic order based on filenames. As a result, `leaflets10.ndx` may appear before `leaflets2.ndx`. Always verify the order of NDX files and ensure that filenames are structured so that lexicographic and numerical ordering align. For example, when dealing with frames 1–9999, use filenames like `leaflets0001.ndx` to `leaflets9999.ndx` to maintain the correct order.

## Assignments for every Nth frame

If you want to specify leaflet assignments for every Nth analyzed frame (e.g., every 10th frame), follow these steps:

1. Set the appropriate frequency in the configuration file. For example:
  ```yaml
  leaflets: !FromNdx
    ndx: ["leaflets0001.ndx", "leaflets0002.ndx", "leaflets0003.ndx", "leaflets0004.ndx", (...)]
    heads: "name P"
    upper_leaflet: "UpperLeaflet"
    lower_leaflet: "LowerLeaflet"
    frequency: !Every 10
  ```

2. **Ensure that the number of provided NDX files exactly matches the number of analyzed frames divided by N.** For example, if the trajectory is 10,000 frames long, [every 5th frame is analyzed](timerange.md), and leaflet assignment is performed for every 10th analyzed frame, you must provide 200 NDX files. If you provide less **or more** NDX files, you will get an error during the analysis.# Assigning lipids using a leaflet assignment file

Another method for manually assigning lipids is using a YAML-formatted "leaflet assignment file". Unlike the NDX file method, where groups of atoms are used for assignment, the leaflet classification in this method is provided at the molecular level, with each molecule type having its own section in the file.

## Leaflet assignment file

Consider a very small system consisting of 12 POPE molecules, 10 POPC molecules, and 8 POPG molecules. Let's say that this membrane is asymmetric:

- The upper leaflet contains 12 POPE molecules and 4 POPG molecules.
- The lower leaflet contains 10 POPC molecules and 4 POPG molecules.

The leaflet assignment file for this system should look as follows:

```yaml
POPE:
  - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper]
POPC:
  - [Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
POPG:
  - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
```

Each position in each list corresponds to the leaflet occupied by one lipid molecule of the specified type. The molecules are listed in the order in which their **first atoms** appear in the input structure file.

> **Note:** You can substitute `Upper` and `Lower` with `1` and `0`, respectively, for specifying the 'upper' and 'lower' leaflets.

## Using the leaflet assignment file

Save the leaflet assignment file, for example, as `assignment.yaml`. To use this file with `gorder`, include it in the YAML configuration file as follows:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromFile
  file: assignment.yaml
  frequency: !Once
```

> Ensure the frequency is set to `!Once`, as this leaflet assignment file provides information for only a single frame.

## Inline specification of leaflet assignment

You can also embed the leaflet assignment directly in the configuration file:

```yaml
leaflets: !Inline
  assignment:
    POPE:
      - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper]
    POPC:
      - [Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
    POPG:
      - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
  frequency: !Once
```

## Scrambling-safe leaflet assignment

If lipid flip-flop occurs in your system, you may want to specify the leaflet assignment for each analyzed frame. For example:

```yaml
POPE:
  # first analyzed frame
  - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper]
  # second analyzed frame
  - [Upper, Upper, Lower, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper]
  # third analyzed frame
  - [Upper, Upper, Lower, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Lower, Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper]
  # (...)
POPC:
  - [Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
  - [Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Upper]
  - [Lower, Lower, Lower, Upper, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower, Upper]
  # (...)
POPG:
  - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
  - [Upper, Upper, Upper, Upper, Lower, Lower, Lower, Lower]
  - [Upper, Upper, Lower, Upper, Upper, Lower, Lower, Lower]
  # (...)
```

To use this expanded file, specify it in the configuration YAML file:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromFile
  file: assignment.yaml
  frequency: !Every 1
```

Alternatively, since `frequency: !Every 1` is the default setting, you can simplify the configuration:

```yaml
leaflets: !FromFile assignment.yaml
```

## Assignments for every Nth frame

If you want to specify leaflet assignments for every Nth analyzed frame (e.g., every 10th frame), you must:

1. Set the appropriate frequency in the configuration file. For example:
    ```yaml
    leaflets: !FromFile
      file: assignment.yaml
      frequency: !Every 10
    ```
2. **Ensure that the number of frames in the leaflet assignment file exactly matches the number of analyzed frames divided by N.** For example, if the trajectory is 10,000 frames long, [every 5th frame is analyzed](timerange.md), and leaflet assignment is performed for every 10th analyzed frame, the leaflet assignment file must contain information for 200 frames.

> **Note:** `gorder` is **very opinionated** when validating the leaflet assignment file. The file must specify the exact same number of lipid molecules for each molecule type as are present in the analyzed molecular system. Additionally, it must contain **exactly** the number of frames required for the leaflet assignment for the specified trajectory at the specified classification frequency (i.e., not a single unused frame can be present in the leaflet assignment file). The leaflet assignment file also cannot include information about molecule types that do not exist in the system. If any of these criteria are not met, `gorder` will reject the leaflet assignment file. This strict validation reduces the chance of errors, as mistakes in manual assignments are easy to make but can be very difficult to detect otherwise.# Manual membrane normals

For absolute control over membrane normals, `gorder` allows manual specification of membrane normals for individual molecules in individual trajectory frames.

To assign membrane normals, you must first prepare a YAML-formatted membrane normals file. The structure of this file is similar to the ["leaflet assignment file"](leaflets_assignment_file.md#leaflet-assignment-file), which can be used to manually assign lipids to leaflets.

## Membrane normals file

Consider a small system consisting of 12 POPE molecules, 10 POPC molecules, and 8 POPG molecules. We are analyzing a very short trajectory of just three frames.

The membrane normals file for this system might look like the following:

```yaml
POPE:
  # First frame
  - - [0.45298508, -0.46554238, 0.7603123]  # Membrane normal for the first POPE molecule

```

Each innermost vector in the file represents the membrane normal assigned to a lipid molecule of the specified type. The molecules are listed in the order in which their **first atoms** appear in the input structure file. Each list of membrane normal vectors corresponds to one trajectory frame.

> Unlike manual lipid assignment, membrane normals must be provided for every individual trajectory frame. `gorder` strictly validates the input membrane normals file. The file must contain **exactly** the same number of frames as the number of analyzed frames in the trajectory. Additionally, it must include the correct number of lipid molecules for each lipid type, and all lipid types being analyzed (and no additional ones) must be specified. Failure to meet these requirements will result in an error.

## Using the membrane normals file

Save the membrane normals file, for example, as `normals.yaml`. To use this file with `gorder`, reference it in the YAML configuration file as follows:

```yaml
membrane_normal: !FromFile normals.yaml
```

## Specifying membrane normals inline

You can also define membrane normals directly within the configuration YAML file:

```yaml
membrane_normal: !Inline
  POPE:
    - - [0.45298508, -0.46554238, 0.7603123] 
      - [0.2806614, -0.15393148, 0.9473829] 
      - [0.43698093, 0.8893582, 0.13449812]
      - [0.9750763, 0.21927911, -0.03380459]
      - [0.92026454, -0.104457006, 0.37709686]
      - [0.02029758, -0.70020616, -0.71365213]
      - [0.40990028, -0.20503402, -0.88878727]
      - [0.0019937176, -0.2997502, 0.9540157]
      - [0.8564996, 0.47032556, 0.21260813]
      - [0.049487855, 0.96054417, 0.27368945]

```# Using other input file formats

`gorder` is primarily designed for analyzing Gromacs simulations. The most efficient and straightforward way to use it is therefore by providing it with a TPR file and an XTC file. However, `gorder` also supports several other file formats for both [structure/topology](other_structure.md) and [trajectory](other_trajectory.md) files.# Structure and topology file formats

In rare cases where `gorder` cannot read your input TPR file, or if no TPR file is available, you can provide the system structure and topology using alternative file formats. `gorder` supports GRO, PDB, and PQR files as structure files.

For example, the following configuration YAML file is valid if the provided PDB file includes a [connectivity section](https://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/sect10.html) *(and has fewer than 100,000 atoms due to PDB format limitations)*:

```yaml
structure: system.pdb
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "@membrane"
output: order.yaml
```

If the PDB file lacks a connectivity section or if you are using a GRO or PQR file as the input structure, you must also supply a "bonds" file:

```yaml
structure: system.gro
bonds: system.bnd   # the file extension does not matter here
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "@membrane"
output: order.yaml
```

Connectivity information will be read from `system.bnd`. *Note that the connectivity data in the bonds file **overrides** even information in the provided PDB or TPR file.*

> `gorder` identifies the file format based on the file extension: `.tpr` for TPR files, `.gro` for GRO files, `.pdb` for PDB files, and `.pqr` for PQR files. Ensure that the file is named correspondingly.

## Specification of the bonds file

The bonds file format is similar to the PDB connectivity block but simpler and much more flexible. It also supports systems of any (reasonable) size.

Each line in the file contains numbers separated by whitespace. The first number specifies the "target atom" (serial number), and the following numbers specify the atoms bonded to it. Serial numbers correspond to Gromacs numbering, where the first atom is `1`, the second is `2`, and so on (no matter the "atom number" in the input GRO or PDB file).

```bnd
1 2 4
```

In this example, atom `1` is bonded to atoms `2` and `4`. Atoms `2` and `4` are **not** bonded to each other.

Each bond needs to be specified only once (with any order of atoms), but duplicating entries is allowed. For instance, the following bonds files are equivalent:

```bnd
1 2 4
2 3
```

```bnd
1 2 4
2 1 3
3 2
4 1
```

*(The system contains three bonds: atoms `1` and `2`, atoms `1` and `4`, and atoms `2` and `3`.)*

Bonds can be listed in any order, and multiple lines can start with the same target atom. Any number of bonds can be specified on one line. Empty lines are ignored, and any amount of whitespace is allowed between the numbers. Comments can be added using `#`:

```bnd
1 2 4   # atom 1 is bonded to atoms 2 and 4
2 3
```

Here’s an excerpt from an example bonds file:

```bnd
# Example bonds file for an atomistic system
1 2 3 4 5
2 1
3 1
4 1
5 1 6 7 8
6 5
7 5
8 5 9 10 15
9 8
10 8
11 12 13 14 15
12 11
13 11
14 11 16
15 8 11
16 14 17 18 19
# (...)
```

## Note about selecting elements

When using the `element` keyword in [GSL](gsl.md) atom selection queries, atoms are selected based on their associated element. Element information is natively available in TPR files but is missing in other supported formats. If a non-TPR file is used, `gorder` will attempt to guess the elements of atoms based on the atom and residue names.

If `gorder` detects potential issues with the guess, it will display a warning in the terminal. You can then evaluate whether the concerns are harmless, avoid using the `element` keyword, or provide a TPR file instead.
# Trajectory file formats

`gorder` is highly optimized to read XTC files as quickly as possible. If you have an XTC file or can generate one, it is recommended to use it. However, `gorder` also supports TRR and GRO trajectory file formats. You can use any of these files instead of an XTC trajectory, and `gorder` will automatically recognize the format based on the file extension.

> `gorder` identifies the file format based on the file extension: `.xtc` for XTC files, `.trr` for TRR files and `.gro` for GRO files. Ensure that your trajectory file is named accordingly.

Note that if you want to specify the analysis time range using `begin` and `end` while providing a GRO trajectory, the file must contain simulation time and step information in the 'title' line, formatted as follows:

```text
Some Arbitrarily Long Title (...) t= SIMULATION_TIME step= SIMULATION_STEP
```

For example:

```text
System t= 100.00000 step= 5000
```# Ignoring periodic boundary conditions

`gorder` fully supports the handling of orthogonal (i.e., rectangular cuboid) periodic boundary conditions (PBC) applied in all three dimensions. If your simulation box is orthogonal and PBC are applied in all three dimensions, you can use a raw trajectory generated by Gromacs directly, without worrying about making molecules whole in the simulation box or dealing with other PBC-related issues. `gorder` will handle everything automatically.

**However**, if your simulation box is **not** orthogonal, `gorder` cannot properly treat the system and you will get an error. In such cases, you must instruct `gorder` to ignore periodic boundary conditions by adding the following line to your configuration YAML file:

```yaml
handle_pbc: false
```

When this option is set to `false`, `gorder` will disregard periodic boundary conditions and the presence of any simulation box. Effectively, it will treat the atoms in your system as if they exist in an infinite, unbound environment. **When ignoring PBC, it is crucial to ensure that all lipid molecules in your system are whole in every frame of the input trajectory.** If your molecules are "broken" at the box boundaries, you may silently get **completely incorrect results!** When ignoring PBC, you will always get a warning reminding you to make molecules whole:

```text
[W] Periodic boundary conditions ignored. Lipid molecules must be made whole!
```

With Gromacs, you can make molecules whole using the following command:

```bash
gmx trjconv -s TPR_FILE -f XTC_FILE -pbc mol -o OUTPUT_XTC_FILE
```

The resulting `OUTPUT_XTC_FILE` should then be used as the trajectory input for `gorder`.

You can of course choose to ignore PBC for any system, even if it has an orthogonal box.

> Note: You do not necessarily have to set `handle_pbc` to `false` when working with an orthogonal box with PBC applied in fewer than three dimensions. However, such systems are untested, so proceed with caution. In case you are not sure the analysis is correct, try using a trajectory with whole molecules, set `handle_pbc` to `false`, and check whether the results change.

## Limitations when ignoring PBC

Be aware of the following limitations when PBC are ignored:

1. **Order parameters for individual leaflets**  
   Ensure that your membrane is fully within the simulation box. For example, if your membrane lies in the xy-plane, ensure it does not extend beyond the limits of the simulation box in the z-dimension or appear fragmented across the periodic boundary. Similarly, if your membrane is a vesicle, it should be located entirely and unbroken within the simulation box. **Failing to meet this requirement may result in entirely incorrect lipid leaflet assignments.** To avoid issues, you may want to center the membrane in the simulation box before running the analysis.

2. **Ordermap dimensions**  
   When constructing ordermaps, you cannot automatically derive their dimensions from the simulation box because it is ignored. You must specify the dimensions manually. Forgetting to do this will result in an error. See [this section of the manual](ordermaps.md#dimensions-of-the-ordermaps) for instructions on setting dimensions.

3. **Reference points for geometry selections**  
   When calculating order parameters for a specific region, you cannot use the dynamic center of the simulation box as the reference point because `gorder` ignores box information. If this constraint is violated, you will get an error. However, you can still use static coordinates or the dynamic center of geometry as the reference point. If using the dynamic center of geometry, ensure that your selected atoms for center calculation are made whole, i.e., are not broken at the simulation box boundary.

4. **Using structures and trajectories not generated by Gromacs**    
   While `gorder` (and Gromacs) interpret [0, 0, 0] as the origin of the simulation box (i.e., one of its corners), some other software treats [0, 0, 0] as the *center* of the simulation box. For basic analyses, this difference should not cause any issues, even if periodic boundaries are ignored, but you should still be aware of it. If you want to be completely sure that your analysis is correct, **translate the system** by half of the box size in each dimension so that [0, 0, 0] aligns with the origin of the simulation box (rather than its center) before running the analysis.

5. **Less efficient implementation of some calculations**  
   When ignoring PBC, some optimization algorithms cannot be used as they rely on the presence of an orthogonal simulation box. As a result, you can expect the [local method for leaflet classification](leaflets.md#local-method-for-leaflet-classification) and [dynamic membrane normals calculation](membrane_normal.md#dynamic-membrane-normal) to be much slower, especially for very large systems.# Extracting all analysis options

When `gorder` runs, it automatically sets many analysis options to their default values if they are not explicitly specified. To view the full set of parameters used in an analysis, including defaults, you can run the `gorder` program with the `--export-config` argument. For example:

```
$ gorder analyze.yaml --export-config analyze_out.yaml
```

The file `analyze_out.yaml` will contain all the input parameters for the analysis, including:
 - parameters specified in the input configuration file,
 - parameters provided on the command line, and
 - default values filled in by `gorder`.

This output file can also be used as a valid input configuration file for subsequent `gorder` runs.# Using `gorder` as a Python package

`gorder` can also be used as a Python package, allowing you to call it directly from your Python code.

To install `gorder`, you can use `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/Ladme/gorder.git#subdirectory=pygorder
```

However, you **should** use the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager instead. To add `gorder` to your `uv` project, run:

```bash
$ uv add git+https://github.com/Ladme/gorder.git#subdirectory=pygorder
```

Next, import the package into your Python code:

```python
import gorder
```

Once imported, you can access all the options and functionality described in this manual.

For instance, the following configuration YAML file:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "@membrane"
output: order.yaml
```

can also by written as the following Python code:

```python
analysis = gorder.Analysis(
    structure = "system.tpr",
    trajectory = "md.xtc",
    analysis_type = gorder.analysis_types.CGOrder("@membrane"),
    output_yaml = "order.yaml",
)
```

You can then run the analysis like this:
```python
results = analysis.run()
```

and either write the results into the output file(s):

```python
results.write()
```

or access them programmatically.

See the Python API documentation on [ladme.github.io/pygorder-docs](https://ladme.github.io/pygorder-docs/) for more information about using `gorder` as a Python package.# Using `gorder` as a Rust crate

`gorder` can also be used as a Rust crate, allowing you to call it directly from your Rust code.

To use `gorder` in your project, first add it as a dependency:

```bash
$ cargo add gorder
```

Next, include the crate into your Rust code:

```rust
use gorder::prelude::*;
```

Once imported, you can access all the options and functionality described in this manual. 

For instance, the following configuration YAML file:

```yaml
structure: system.tpr
trajectory: md.xtc
analysis_type: !CGOrder
  beads: "@membrane"
output: order.yaml
```

can also by written as the following Rust code:

```rust
let analysis = Analysis::builder()
    .structure("system.tpr")
    .trajectory("md.xtc")
    .analysis_type(AnalysisType::cgorder("@membrane"))
    .output("order.yaml")
    .build()?;
```

You can then run the analysis like this:
```rust
let results = analysis.run()?;
```

and either write the results into the output file(s):

```rust
results.write()?;
```

or access them programmatically.

See the Rust API documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gorder/latest/gorder) for more information about using `gorder` as a Rust crate.# Limitations

While `gorder` aims to provide accurate and reliable results, there are some known limitations and scenarios where it may not be suitable. The current limitations are as follows:

1. **`gorder` cannot read TPR files generated with Gromacs versions older than 5.1.**
   - **Why is this the case?** This limitation stems from the [`minitpr`](https://github.com/Ladme/minitpr) crate used to parse TPR files. The TPR file format evolves constantly, and supporting all ancient Gromacs versions is simply not feasible.
   - **What can you do if your TPR file is this old?** In most cases, the solution is simple: convert the old TPR file using a new version of Gromacs, i.e., run `gmx convert-tpr -s old_file.tpr -o new_file.tpr`. If converting a TPR file is not an option for you, you can instead provide a PDB file with a connectivity section or a GRO file along with a bonds file (see [Using other input file formats](other_input.md)).
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** Older Gromacs versions will likely **never** be fully supported.
2. **`gorder` only fully supports systems with orthogonal simulation boxes and periodic boundary conditions applied in all three dimensions.**
   - **Why is this the case?** This limitation arises from the [`groan_rs`](https://github.com/Ladme/groan_rs) crate, which provides only partial support for non-orthogonal simulation boxes. Handling periodic boundary conditions in such boxes is complex and not fully implemented at present.
   - **What can you do if your box is not orthogonal?** You must instruct `gorder` to [ignore periodic boundary conditions](no_pbc.md). Then, provide a trajectory where the lipid molecules are whole, and perform the analysis as usual.
   - **What can you do if your system is not periodic in some dimensions?** In most cases, there will be no issue; however, such systems have not been tested, and artifacts may occur. You can try [ignoring periodic boundary conditions](no_pbc.md) while ensuring the lipid molecules are whole and verify if the results change.
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** `gorder` is unlikely to ever fully support non-orthogonal simulation boxes, simply because they are not common in membrane simulations. However, better support for partially periodic systems might be added in the future.
3. **`gorder` does not fully support the analysis of systems with multiple membranes.**
   - **Why is this the case?** Handling multiple membranes is complex, and such systems are relatively uncommon. `gorder` is primarily designed for analyzing single-membrane systems. This does not mean you cannot use it for multi-membrane systems, but some features may not work as expected (see below).
   - **What can you do if your system contains multiple membranes?** If you are performing basic analysis with a static membrane normal and no leaflet assignment, no special action is required. However, be aware that order parameters from all membranes will be averaged into a single collective set of order parameters. If you are assigning leaflets, note that the only usable automatic classification method is the `individual` method. If you are using dynamic membrane normal calculation, ensure that the membranes are sufficiently far apart: specifically, farther than the `radius` value used in the membrane normal calculation. You can of course also select atoms from a single membrane for analysis, but make sure to consistently apply this selection across all relevant sections, particularly in dynamic membrane normal calculation.
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** Will `gorder` ever support membrane-specific order parameter calculations? This is highly unlikely. Multi-membrane systems are rare, and membrane-wise analysis can be performed by running individual analyses with different atom selections. Since `gorder` is fast (and even faster when the trajectory is already cached), performing multiple runs should not be a significant issue.
4. **`gorder` fails when analyzing simulations longer than 2,147,483,647 simulation steps.**
   *(Note that this corresponds to simulation length of roughly 4.3 μs at 2 fs time step.)*
   - **Why is this the case?** This limitation stems from the [`molly`](https://github.com/ma3ke/molly) crate used to parse XTC files (and partially from the design of XTC files themselves). The simulation step in an XTC file is a 4-byte signed integer whose maximum value is 2,147,483,647. If a higher step is reached, `molly` crashes with an error instead of overflowing like many other libraries. Read more [here](https://github.com/Ladme/gorder/issues/14) and [here](https://github.com/ma3ke/molly/issues/1).
   - **What can you do if your trajectory is this long?** Remove the step information from your trajectory. A recommended approach is to use the [step2frame](https://github.com/Ladme/step2frame) tool, which generates a trajectory where step numbers are replaced with frame numbers. Use the converted trajectory as the input trajectory for `gorder`.
   - **Will this be addressed in the future?** Yes — either by fixing the issue in the `molly` crate or by allowing compilation of `gorder` without `molly` (which would, however, make `gorder` slower).

# GSL guide

# Introduction

Groan Selection Language (GSL) is a query language for selecting atoms in the [`groan_rs`](https://github.com/Ladme/groan_rs) crate and in programs built on top of it, such as [`gorder`](https://github.com/Ladme/gorder) or [`gcenter`](https://github.com/Ladme/gcenter).

The selection language is quite similar to the languages used by [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) and [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/), so if you are familiar with them, GSL should feel quite intuitive. This guide should help you understand and efficiently use GSL both when working directly with the `groan_rs` library and when using applications built on top of it.

***

*This document describes the syntax of GSL v0.11 (corresponding to `groan_rs` v0.11).*# Basic queries

GSL allows you to select atoms based on their attributes. Here's how you can perform basic selections:

### 1. Residue names

Select atoms belonging to residues with specific names.

- **Syntax:** `resname XYZ`
- **Example:** `resname POPE`
  
*Selects all atoms in residues named POPE.*

### 2. Residue numbers

Select atoms based on their residue numbers.

- **Syntax:** `resid XYZ` or `resnum XYZ`
- **Example:** `resid 17`
  
*Selects all atoms in residue number 17.*

### 3. Atom names

Select atoms with specific atom names.

- **Syntax:** `name XYZ` or `atomname XYZ`
- **Example:** `name P`
  
*Selects all atoms named P.*

### 4. Serial atom numbers

Select atoms based on their serial atom numbers as understood by GROMACS.

- **Syntax:** `serial XYZ`
- **Example:** `serial 256`
  
*Selects the atom with serial atom number 256.*

> **Note:** This selection is determined using GROMACS's internal atom numbering, not the numbering found in GRO or PDB files. Here, numbering starts at 1 for the first atom and increases sequentially. Each atom is guaranteed to a have a unique serial number.

### 5. GRO/PDB atom numbers

Select atoms based on their atom numbers in the originating GRO or PDB file.

- **Syntax:** `atomnum XYZ`
- **Example:** `atomnum 124`
  
*Selects all atoms with atom number 124 in the input file.*

> **Note:** There is no guarantee that one specific atom number will be assigned to exactly one atom.

### 6. Chain identifiers

Select atoms belonging to specific chains.

- **Syntax:** `chain X`
- **Example:** `chain A`
  
  *Selects all atoms in chain 'A'.*

> **Note:** Chain information is typically available in PDB files. If absent, this selection will yield no results.

### 7. Element names

Select atoms based on their element names.

- **Syntax:** `element name XYZ` or `elname XYZ`
- **Example:** `element name carbon`
  
*Selects all carbon atoms.*

> **Note:** Element information must be available. If absent, this selection will yield no results. Read more [here](notes.md/#selecting-elements).

### 8. Element symbols

Select atoms based on their element symbols.

- **Syntax:** `element symbol X` or `elsymbol X`
- **Example:** `element symbol C`
  
*Selects all carbon atoms.*

> **Note:** Element information must be available. If absent, this selection will yield no results. Read more [here](notes.md/#selecting-elements).

### 9. Labels

Select atoms using predefined labels.

- **Syntax:** `label XYZ`
  
*Labels are discussed in detail [later](labeling.md) in this tutorial.*
# Multiple identifiers

GSL allows you to specify multiple identifiers within a single query, enabling the selection of atoms matching **any** of the provided criteria.

### Examples:

- **Residue names:**
  
  ```gsl
  resname POPE POPG
  ```

    *Selects all atoms in residues named POPE or POPG.*

- **Residue numbers:**
  
  ```gsl
  resid 13 15 16 17
  ```

    *Selects atoms in residues numbered 13, 15, 16, or 17.*

- **Atom names:**
  
  ```gsl
  name P CA HA
  ```

    *Selects atoms named P, CA, or HA.*

- **Serial numbers:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 245 267 269 271
  ```

    *Selects atoms with serial numbers 245, 267, 269, or 271.*

- **Chains:**
  
  ```gsl
  chain A B C
  ```

    *Selects atoms in chains 'A', 'B', or 'C'.*

- **Element names:**
  
  ```gsl
  elname carbon hydrogen
  ```

    *Selects all carbon and hydrogen atoms.*

- **Element symbols:**
  
  ```gsl
  elsymbol C H
  ```

    *Selects all carbon and hydrogen atoms.*
# Selecting atoms using groups

GSL allows you to select atoms using the previously constructed groups of atoms.

### Creating groups

Before selecting using groups, you must construct them. This is typically done within your workflow or by loading predefined groups, e.g. [from NDX files](#loading-groups-from-ndx-files).

### Selecting groups

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  group GroupName1 GroupName2
  ```

  *Or simply:*

  ```gsl
  GroupName1 GroupName2
  ```

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  Protein Membrane
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in the groups named "Protein" and "Membrane".*

> **Important:** If a specified group does not exist, an error will be raised.

### Loading groups from NDX files

If you've loaded an NDX file using [`System::read_ndx`](https://docs.rs/groan_rs/latest/groan_rs/system/struct.System.html#method.read_ndx), you can utilize groups defined within that file.

> **Note:** If a program using `groan_rs` loads an NDX file, you will typically be able to select groups defined in the NDX file.

### Groups with multiple words

For groups with names comprising multiple words, enclose the group name in quotes.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  Protein 'My Lipids'
  ```

  *Selects atoms in the "Protein" group and the "My Lipids" group.*
# Selecting atoms by autodetection

GSL offers macros that automatically detect and select common molecular components. These macros simplify selections without needing to specify detailed criteria. GSL macros support atomistic, united-atom, and coarse-grained systems.

### Available macros:

- `@protein`: Selects all amino acid atoms (supports ~140 different amino acids).
- `@water`: Selects all water atoms.
- `@ion`: Selects all ion atoms.
- `@membrane`: Selects membrane lipid atoms.
- `@dna`: Selects all DNA molecule atoms.
- `@rna`: Selects all RNA molecule atoms.

### Example usage:

```gsl
@protein or @membrane
```

*Selects all protein and membrane lipid atoms.*

> **Caution:** While these macros are generally reliable, they may not always perfectly identify all relevant atoms. Use them judiciously, especially when working with custom molecules.

### Macro definitions:

The following list shows how GSL macros currently expand. Note that these definitions may change in future versions to support additional atom matching:

- `@protein` = `resname ABU ACE AIB ALA ARG ARGN ASN ASN1 ASP ASP1 ASPH ASPP ASH CT3 CYS CYS1 CYS2 CYSH DALA GLN GLU GLUH GLUP GLH GLY HIS HIS1 HISA HISB HISH HISD HISE HISP HSD HSE HSP HYP ILE LEU LSN LYS LYSN LYSH MELEU MET MEVAL NAC NME NHE NH2 PHE PHEH PHEU PHL PRO SER THR TRP TRPH TRPU TYR TYRH TYRU VAL PGLU HID HIE HIP LYP LYN CYN CYM CYX DAB ORN HYP NALA NGLY NSER NTHR NLEU NILE NVAL NASN NGLN NARG NHID NHIE NHIP NHISD NHISE NHISH NTRP NPHE NTYR NGLU NASP NLYS NORN NDAB NLYSN NPRO NHYP NCYS NCYS2 NMET NASPH NGLUH CALA CGLY CSER CTHR CLEU CILE CVAL CASN CGLN CARG CHID CHIE CHIP CHISD CHISE CHISH CTRP CPHE CTYR CGLU CASP CLYS CORN CDAB CLYSN CPRO CHYP CCYS CCYS2 CMET CASPH CGLUH`

### Note about older versions of GSL:

In GSL versions <0.11 (`groan_rs` v0.10 and older), the `@membrane` macro was defined followingly:
- `@membrane` = `resname DAPC DBPC DFPC DGPC DIPC DLPC DNPC DOPC DPPC DUPC DRPC DTPC DVPC DXPC DYPC LPPC PAPC PEPC PGPC PIPC POPC PRPC PUPC DAPE DBPE DFPE DGPE DIPE DLPE DNPE DOPE DPPE DRPE DTPE DUPE DVPE DXPE DYPE LPPE PAPE PGPE PIPE POPE PQPE PRPE PUPE DAPS DBPS DFPS DGPS DIPS DLPS DNPS DOPS DPPS DRPS DTPS DUPS DVPS DXPS DYPS LPPS PAPS PGPS PIPS POPS PQPS PRPS PUPS DAPG DBPG DFPG DGPG DIPG DLPG DNPG DOPG DPPG DRPG DTPG DVPG DXPG DYPG JFPG JPPG LPPG OPPG PAPG PGPG PIPG POPG PRPG DAPA DBPA DFPA DGPA DIPA DLPA DNPA DOPA DPPA DRPA DTPA DVPA DXPA DYPA LPPA PAPA PGPA PIPA POPA PRPA PUPA DPP1 DPP2 DPPI PAPI PIPI POP1 POP2 POP3 POPI PUPI PVP1 PVP2 PVP3 PVPI PADG PIDG PODG PUDG PVDG TOG APC CPC IPC LPC OPC PPC TPC UPC VPC BNSM DBSM DPSM DXSM PGSM PNSM POSM PVSM XNSM DPCE DXCE PNCE XNCE DBG1 DPG1 DPG3 DPGS DXG1 DXG3 PNG1 PNG3 XNG1 XNG3 DFGG DFMG DPGG DPMG DPSG FPGG FPMG FPSG OPGG OPMG OPSG CHOA CHOL CHYO BOG DDM DPC EO5 SDS BOLA BOLB CDL0 CDL1 CDL2 CDL DBG3 ERGO HBHT HDPT HHOP HOPR ACA ACN BCA BCN LCA LCN PCA PCN UCA UCN XCA XCN RAMP REMP OANT`

Groan Selection Language (GSL) is a query language for selecting atoms in the [`groan_rs`](https://github.com/Ladme/groan_rs) crate and in programs built on top of it, such as [`gorder`](https://github.com/Ladme/gorder) or [`gcenter`](https://github.com/Ladme/gcenter).

***

*This document describes the syntax of GSL v0.11 (corresponding to `groan_rs` v0.11).*# Basic queries

GSL allows you to select atoms based on their attributes. Here's how you can perform basic selections:

### 1. Residue names

> **Note:** Element information must be available. If absent, this selection will yield no results. Read more [here](notes.md/#selecting-elements).

### 9. Labels

Select atoms using predefined labels.

- **Syntax:** `label XYZ`
  
*Labels are discussed in detail [later](labeling.md) in this tutorial.*
# Multiple identifiers

GSL allows you to specify multiple identifiers within a single query, enabling the selection of atoms matching **any** of the provided criteria.

### Examples:

- **Residue names:**
  
  ```gsl
  resname POPE POPG
  ```

    *Selects all atoms in residues named POPE or POPG.*

- **Residue numbers:**
  
  ```gsl
  resid 13 15 16 17
  ```

    *Selects atoms in residues numbered 13, 15, 16, or 17.*

- **Atom names:**
  
  ```gsl
  name P CA HA
  ```

    *Selects atoms named P, CA, or HA.*

- **Serial numbers:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 245 267 269 271
  ```

    *Selects atoms with serial numbers 245, 267, 269, or 271.*

- **Chains:**
  
  ```gsl
  chain A B C
  ```

    *Selects atoms in chains 'A', 'B', or 'C'.*

- **Element names:**
  
  ```gsl
  elname carbon hydrogen
  ```

    *Selects all carbon and hydrogen atoms.*

- **Element symbols:**
  
  ```gsl
  elsymbol C H
  ```

    *Selects all carbon and hydrogen atoms.*
# Selecting atoms using groups

GSL allows you to select atoms using the previously constructed groups of atoms.

### Creating groups

Before selecting using groups, you must construct them. This is typically done within your workflow or by loading predefined groups, e.g. [from NDX files](#loading-groups-from-ndx-files).

### Selecting groups

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  group GroupName1 GroupName2
  ```

  *Or simply:*

  ```gsl
  GroupName1 GroupName2
  ```

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  Protein Membrane
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in the groups named "Protein" and "Membrane".*

> **Important:** If a specified group does not exist, an error will be raised.

### Loading groups from NDX files

If you've loaded an NDX file using [`System::read_ndx`](https://docs.rs/groan_rs/latest/groan_rs/system/struct.System.html#method.read_ndx), you can utilize groups defined within that file.

> **Note:** If a program using `groan_rs` loads an NDX file, you will typically be able to select groups defined in the NDX file.

### Groups with multiple words

For groups with names comprising multiple words, enclose the group name in quotes.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  Protein 'My Lipids'
  ```

  *Selects atoms in the "Protein" group and the "My Lipids" group.*
# Selecting atoms by autodetection

GSL offers macros that automatically detect and select common molecular components. These macros simplify selections without needing to specify detailed criteria. GSL macros support atomistic, united-atom, and coarse-grained systems.

### Available macros:

- `@protein`: Selects all amino acid atoms (supports ~140 different amino acids).
- `@water`: Selects all water atoms.
- `@ion`: Selects all ion atoms.
- `@membrane`: Selects membrane lipid atoms.
- `@dna`: Selects all DNA molecule atoms.
- `@rna`: Selects all RNA molecule atoms.

### Example usage:

```gsl
@protein or @membrane
```

*Selects all protein and membrane lipid atoms.*

> **Caution:** While these macros are generally reliable, they may not always perfectly identify all relevant atoms. Use them judiciously, especially when working with custom molecules.

### Macro definitions:

The following list shows how GSL macros currently expand. Note that these definitions may change in future versions to support additional atom matching:

- `@protein` = `resname ABU ACE AIB ALA ARG ARGN ASN ASN1 ASP ASP1 ASPH ASPP ASH CT3 CYS CYS1 CYS2 CYSH DALA GLN GLU GLUH GLUP GLH GLY HIS HIS1 HISA HISB HISH HISD HISE HISP HSD HSE HSP HYP ILE LEU LSN LYS LYSN LYSH MELEU MET MEVAL NAC NME NHE NH2 PHE PHEH PHEU PHL PRO SER THR TRP TRPH TRPU TYR TYRH TYRU VAL PGLU HID HIE HIP LYP LYN CYN CYM CYX DAB ORN HYP NALA NGLY NSER NTHR NLEU NILE NVAL NASN NGLN NARG NHID NHIE NHIP NHISD NHISE NHISH NTRP NPHE NTYR NGLU NASP NLYS NORN NDAB NLYSN NPRO NHYP NCYS NCYS2 NMET NASPH NGLUH CALA CGLY CSER CTHR CLEU CILE CVAL CASN CGLN CARG CHID CHIE CHIP CHISD CHISE CHISH CTRP CPHE CTYR CGLU CASP CLYS CORN CDAB CLYSN CPRO CHYP CCYS CCYS2 CMET CASPH CGLUH`

- `@dna` = `resname DA DG DC DT DA5 DG5 DC5 DT5 DA3 DG3 DC3 DT3 DAN DGN DCN DTN`
- `@rna` = `resname A U C G RA RU RC RG RA5 RT5 RU5 RC5 RG5 RA3 RT3 RU3 RC3 RG3 RAN RTN RUN RCN RGN`

### Note about older versions of GSL:

In GSL versions <0.11 (`groan_rs` v0.10 and older), the `@membrane` macro was defined followingly:
- `@membrane` = `resname DAPC DBPC DFPC DGPC DIPC DLPC DNPC DOPC DPPC DUPC DRPC DTPC DVPC DXPC DYPC LPPC PAPC PEPC PGPC PIPC POPC PRPC PUPC DAPE DBPE DFPE DGPE DIPE DLPE DNPE DOPE DPPE DRPE DTPE DUPE DVPE DXPE DYPE LPPE PAPE PGPE PIPE POPE PQPE PRPE PUPE DAPS DBPS DFPS DGPS DIPS DLPS DNPS DOPS DPPS DRPS DTPS DUPS DVPS DXPS DYPS LPPS PAPS PGPS PIPS POPS PQPS PRPS PUPS DAPG DBPG DFPG DGPG DIPG DLPG DNPG DOPG DPPG DRPG DTPG DVPG DXPG DYPG JFPG JPPG LPPG OPPG PAPG PGPG PIPG POPG PRPG DAPA DBPA DFPA DGPA DIPA DLPA DNPA DOPA DPPA DRPA DTPA DVPA DXPA DYPA LPPA PAPA PGPA PIPA POPA PRPA PUPA DPP1 DPP2 DPPI PAPI PIPI POP1 POP2 POP3 POPI PUPI PVP1 PVP2 PVP3 PVPI PADG PIDG PODG PUDG PVDG TOG APC CPC IPC LPC OPC PPC TPC UPC VPC BNSM DBSM DPSM DXSM PGSM PNSM POSM PVSM XNSM DPCE DXCE PNCE XNCE DBG1 DPG1 DPG3 DPGS DXG1 DXG3 PNG1 PNG3 XNG1 XNG3 DFGG DFMG DPGG DPMG DPSG FPGG FPMG FPSG OPGG OPMG OPSG CHOA CHOL CHYO BOG DDM DPC EO5 SDS BOLA BOLB CDL0 CDL1 CDL2 CDL DBG3 ERGO HBHT HDPT HHOP HOPR ACA ACN BCA BCN LCA LCN PCA PCN UCA UCN XCA XCN RAMP REMP OANT`

> This version of the `@membrane` macro is used in `gorder` versions ≤1.0.0 and `gcenter` versions ≤2.0.0.# Ranges

GSL allows you to specify ranges of residue or atom numbers.

### Specifying ranges

- **Using `to`:**
  
  ```gsl
  resid 14 to 20
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues numbered 14 through 20 (including 20).*

- **Using `-`:**
  
  ```gsl
  resid 14-20
  ```

  *Equivalent to `resid 14 to 20`.*

### Combining with multiple ranges and numbers

You can mix explicit numbers with ranges for more complex selections.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 1 3 to 6 10 12-14 17
  ```

  *Expands to selecting serial numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 17.*

### Open-ended ranges

GSL supports open-ended ranges using comparison operators.

- **Operators:**
  - `<` : Less than
  - `>` : Greater than
  - `<=`: Less than or equal to
  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial <= 180
  ```

  *Selects all atoms with serial numbers ≤ 180.*
  
  ```gsl
  resid > 33
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues numbered 34 and above.*

### Combining open-ended and explicit selections

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 1 3-6 >=20
  ```

  *Selects atoms with serial numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 20 or higher.*

# Negations

GSL allows you to exclude certain atoms from your selection using negation operators.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  not <query>
  ```

  *Or:*

  ```gsl
  ! <query>
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  not name CA
  ```

  *Selects all atoms **not** named CA.*
  
  ```gsl
  ! name CA
  ```

  *Equivalent to the above.*
  
  ```gsl
  not resname POPE POPG
  ```

  *Selects atoms not in residues named POPE or POPG.*
  
  ```gsl
  !Protein
  ```

  *Selects atoms not in the group named "Protein".*
# Binary operations

GSL supports combining multiple queries using logical operators to refine selections further.

### Logical AND

- **Operators:** `and` or `&&`
- **Function:** Selects atoms that satisfy **both** queries.

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name P and resname POPE
  ```

  *Selects atoms named P in residues named POPE.*

  ```gsl
  serial 256 to 271 && resid 17 18
  ```

  *Selects atoms with serial numbers between 256 and 271 in residues 17 or 18.*

### Logical OR

- **Operators:** `or` or `||`
- **Function:** Selects atoms that satisfy **at least one** of the queries. Can be understood as an addition (**+**) operation.

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name P or resname POPE
  ```

  *Selects atoms named P **+** atoms in residues POPE.*

  ```gsl
  resid 17 18 || serial 256 to 271
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues 17 or 18 **+** atoms with serial numbers between 256 and 271.*

### Operator precedence

When combining multiple `and` and `or` operators, GSL evaluates them from **left to right**.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  resname POPE or name CA and not Protein
  ```

  *Interpreted as:*  
  *(resname POPE **or** name CA) **and not** Protein*

  *Selects atoms in residues named POPE **+** atoms named CA **−** (minus) atoms that are part of the "Protein" group.*

### Combining with autodetection macros

You can mix autodetection macros with other queries using logical operators.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  @membrane or group 'My Lipids'
  ```

  *Selects all autodetected membrane lipids **+** atoms in the "My Lipids" group.*

# Parentheses

Parentheses allow you to control the evaluation order of your queries.

### Changing evaluation order

Use parentheses to group queries and dictate the sequence of operations.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  resname POPE or (name CA and not resid 18 to 21)
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues named POPE **+** atoms named CA which are not in residues 18 to 21.*

- **Changing the position of parentheses:**
  
  ```gsl
  (name CA or resname POPE) and not resid 18 to 21
  ```

  *Selects atoms which are either named CA or in residues named POPE, **but are not** in residues 18 to 21.*

### Nested Parentheses

You can nest parentheses to create complex selection logic.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 1 to 6 or (name CA and resname POPE || (resid 1 to 7 or serial 123 to 128)) and Protein
  ```

  *A valid, albeit complex, query that combines multiple conditions.*

### Negating Parenthetical Expressions

You can apply negation to entire parenthetical groups.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  !(serial 1 to 6 && name P)
  ```

  *Selects atoms that **do not** have serial numbers between 1 and 6 while being named P.*

# Selecting molecules

GSL provides operators to select entire molecules (i.e., groups of bonded atoms) based on specific criteria.

### `molecule with` (or `mol with`) operator

- **Function:** Selects all atoms in the same molecule(s) as the atoms matching the inner query.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with <query>
  ```

  *Or:*

  ```gsl
  mol with <query>
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with serial 15
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in the molecule containing the atom with serial number 15.*
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with resid 4 17 29
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in molecules containing any atom from residues 4, 17, or 29.*
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with name P
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in molecules that include an atom named P.*

### Operator precedence with `molecule with`

- **Example 1:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with serial 15 or name BB
  ```

  *Selects atoms in the molecule containing serial 15 **+** selects atoms named BB.*

- **Example 2:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with (serial 15 or name BB)
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in molecules that contain either atom 15 **or** any atom named BB.*


> **Note:**
> - **Topology requirement:** The system must contain topology information to use molecule selections. Without it, no atoms will be selected. Topology information is available, for instance, in TPR files and some PDB files.

# Labeling atoms

If atoms are labeled (using [`System::label_atom`](https://docs.rs/groan_rs/latest/groan_rs/system/struct.System.html#method.label_atom)), you can use these labels in your GSL queries.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  label XYZ
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  label MyAtom
  ```

  *Selects the atom labeled "MyAtom".*
  
  ```gsl
  label MyAtom AnotherAtom OneMoreAtom
  ```

  *Selects atoms labeled "MyAtom", "AnotherAtom", and "OneMoreAtom".*

### Labels with multiple words

For labels consisting of multiple words, enclose them in quotes.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  label 'Very interesting atom'
  ```

  *Selects the atom labeled "Very interesting atom".*

> **Comparison with groups:**  
> Labels are similar to groups but are guaranteed to contain **only one atom** each.

# Regular expressions

GSL supports the use of regular expressions (regex).

### Using regular expressions

You can apply regex patterns to various identifiers: atom names, residue names, group names, element names, element symbols, and labels.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  identifier r'<pattern>'
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name r'^[1-9]?H.*'
  ```

  *Selects all atoms with names matching the regex pattern (typically hydrogen atoms).*
  
  ```gsl
  resname r'^.*PC'
  ```

  *Selects all residues with names ending in "PC".*
  
  ```gsl
  group r'^P'
  ```

  *Selects all groups with names starting with 'P'.*

### Combining regular expressions with other identifiers

You can mix regex-based identifiers with standard identifiers in a single query.

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name r'^C.*' and resname ALA GLY
  ```

  *Selects atoms with names starting with 'C' in residues named ALA or GLY.*

  ```gsl
  name P r'^[1-9]?H.*'
  ```
  
  *Selects atoms named 'P' and hydrogen atoms.*

### Syntax rules

- **Enclosure:**  
  The regex pattern must be enclosed within a "regular expression block" starting with `r'` and ending with `'`.

- **Case sensitivity:**  
  Regex patterns are case-sensitive unless specified otherwise within the pattern.

### Supported regex features

GSL uses the `regex` crate for evaluating regular expressions. For detailed information on supported regex features, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).

# Important notes

### Selecting Elements

- **Element assignment:**  
  Atoms in the system **are not** automatically assigned elements by `groan_rs` unless the elements are explicitly specified in the input structure file. *This is because elements may not always be meaningful, particularly in coarse-grained systems.*

- **Using `element` keywords:**  
  To use `element name` or `element symbol` in your selections, ensure that atoms have been assigned elements.

- **Assigning elements:**
  - **From topology files:** Creating the `System` structure from a TPR file automatically assigns elements.
  - **Guessing elements:** Use the [`System::guess_elements`](https://docs.rs/groan_rs/latest/groan_rs/system/struct.System.html#method.guess_elements) function to assign elements based on atom names.

- **Recommendation:**  
  If you're using a program that utilizes GSL, ensure that it assigns elements to atoms before using `element` keywords in selections.

### Whitespace considerations

- **Operator and parenthesis separation:**  
  Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, etc.) and parentheses do **not** need to be separated by whitespace unless it affects query clarity.

- **Valid example:**
  
  ```gsl
  not(name CA)or(serial 1to45||Protein)
  ```
  
  *A valid query without (unnecessary) whitespace.*

- **Invalid example:**
  
  ```gsl
  not(name CA)or(serial 1to45orProtein)
  ```
  
  *Invalid because `orProtein` is unclear.*

- **Resolving ambiguity:**
  
  Enclose ambiguous parts in parentheses to clarify intent. **Or use whitespace, it is worth it.**
  
  ```gsl
  not(name CA)or(serial 1to45or(Protein))
  ```
  
  *Now, the query is valid and interpretable, but not very human-readable.*
# Online GSL validator

You can easily verify the validity of your GSL query using the [online validation tool](https://ladme.github.io/gsl-validator/).

> **Note:** This tool checks only the general syntax of the query. It does not account for the specific context of your molecular system. Queries that reference non-existent groups in your system will still be considered valid syntactically but will fail during execution. The tool focuses solely on syntactical correctness and cannot interpret your intent. For example, the query `resname POPC name P` is syntactically valid but will probably not achieve the desired outcome.# Feedback and disclaimer

*This guide was largely generated by a large language model (ChatGPT) based on the provided GSL specification.*# Ranges

GSL allows you to specify ranges of residue or atom numbers.

### Specifying ranges

- **Using `to`:**
  
  ```gsl
  resid 14 to 20
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues numbered 14 through 20 (including 20).*

- **Using `-`:**
  
  ```gsl
  resid 14-20
  ```

  *Equivalent to `resid 14 to 20`.*

### Combining with multiple ranges and numbers

You can mix explicit numbers with ranges for more complex selections.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 1 3 to 6 10 12-14 17
  ```

  *Expands to selecting serial numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 17.*

### Open-ended ranges

GSL supports open-ended ranges using comparison operators.

- **Operators:**
  - `<` : Less than
  - `>` : Greater than
  - `<=`: Less than or equal to
  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial <= 180
  ```

  *Selects all atoms with serial numbers ≤ 180.*
  
  ```gsl
  resid > 33
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues numbered 34 and above.*

### Combining open-ended and explicit selections

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 1 3-6 >=20
  ```

  *Selects atoms with serial numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 20 or higher.*

# Negations

GSL allows you to exclude certain atoms from your selection using negation operators.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  not <query>
  ```

  *Or:*

  ```gsl
  ! <query>
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  not name CA
  ```

  *Selects all atoms **not** named CA.*
  
  ```gsl
  ! name CA
  ```

  *Equivalent to the above.*
  
  ```gsl
  not resname POPE POPG
  ```

  *Selects atoms not in residues named POPE or POPG.*
  
  ```gsl
  !Protein
  ```

  *Selects atoms not in the group named "Protein".*
# Binary operations

GSL supports combining multiple queries using logical operators to refine selections further.

### Logical AND

- **Operators:** `and` or `&&`
- **Function:** Selects atoms that satisfy **both** queries.

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name P and resname POPE
  ```

  *Selects atoms named P in residues named POPE.*

  ```gsl
  serial 256 to 271 && resid 17 18
  ```

  *Selects atoms with serial numbers between 256 and 271 in residues 17 or 18.*

### Logical OR

- **Operators:** `or` or `||`
- **Function:** Selects atoms that satisfy **at least one** of the queries. Can be understood as an addition (**+**) operation.

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name P or resname POPE
  ```

  *Selects atoms named P **+** atoms in residues POPE.*

  ```gsl
  resid 17 18 || serial 256 to 271
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues 17 or 18 **+** atoms with serial numbers between 256 and 271.*

### Operator precedence

When combining multiple `and` and `or` operators, GSL evaluates them from **left to right**.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  resname POPE or name CA and not Protein
  ```

  *Interpreted as:*  
  *(resname POPE **or** name CA) **and not** Protein*

  *Selects atoms in residues named POPE **+** atoms named CA **−** (minus) atoms that are part of the "Protein" group.*

### Combining with autodetection macros

You can mix autodetection macros with other queries using logical operators.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  @membrane or group 'My Lipids'
  ```

  *Selects all autodetected membrane lipids **+** atoms in the "My Lipids" group.*

# Parentheses

Parentheses allow you to control the evaluation order of your queries.

### Changing evaluation order

Use parentheses to group queries and dictate the sequence of operations.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  resname POPE or (name CA and not resid 18 to 21)
  ```

  *Selects atoms in residues named POPE **+** atoms named CA which are not in residues 18 to 21.*

  ```

  *Selects atoms which are either named CA or in residues named POPE, **but are not** in residues 18 to 21.*

### Nested Parentheses

You can nest parentheses to create complex selection logic.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  serial 1 to 6 or (name CA and resname POPE || (resid 1 to 7 or serial 123 to 128)) and Protein
  ```

  *A valid, albeit complex, query that combines multiple conditions.*

### Negating Parenthetical Expressions

You can apply negation to entire parenthetical groups.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  !(serial 1 to 6 && name P)
  ```

  *Selects atoms that **do not** have serial numbers between 1 and 6 while being named P.*

# Selecting molecules

GSL provides operators to select entire molecules (i.e., groups of bonded atoms) based on specific criteria.

### `molecule with` (or `mol with`) operator

- **Function:** Selects all atoms in the same molecule(s) as the atoms matching the inner query.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with <query>
  ```

  *Or:*

  ```gsl
  mol with <query>
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with serial 15
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in the molecule containing the atom with serial number 15.*
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with resid 4 17 29
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in molecules containing any atom from residues 4, 17, or 29.*
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with name P
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in molecules that include an atom named P.*

### Operator precedence with `molecule with`

- **Example 1:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with serial 15 or name BB
  ```

  *Selects atoms in the molecule containing serial 15 **+** selects atoms named BB.*

- **Example 2:**
  
  ```gsl
  molecule with (serial 15 or name BB)
  ```

  *Selects all atoms in molecules that contain either atom 15 **or** any atom named BB.*


> **Note:**
> - **Topology requirement:** The system must contain topology information to use molecule selections. Without it, no atoms will be selected. Topology information is available, for instance, in TPR files and some PDB files.

# Labeling atoms

If atoms are labeled (using [`System::label_atom`](https://docs.rs/groan_rs/latest/groan_rs/system/struct.System.html#method.label_atom)), you can use these labels in your GSL queries.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  label XYZ
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  label MyAtom
  ```

  *Selects the atom labeled "MyAtom".*
  
  ```gsl
  label MyAtom AnotherAtom OneMoreAtom
  ```

  *Selects atoms labeled "MyAtom", "AnotherAtom", and "OneMoreAtom".*

### Labels with multiple words

For labels consisting of multiple words, enclose them in quotes.

- **Example:**
  
  ```gsl
  label 'Very interesting atom'
  ```

  *Selects the atom labeled "Very interesting atom".*

> **Comparison with groups:**  
> Labels are similar to groups but are guaranteed to contain **only one atom** each.

# Regular expressions

GSL supports the use of regular expressions (regex).

### Using regular expressions

You can apply regex patterns to various identifiers: atom names, residue names, group names, element names, element symbols, and labels.

- **Syntax:**
  
  ```gsl
  identifier r'<pattern>'
  ```

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name r'^[1-9]?H.*'
  ```

  *Selects all atoms with names matching the regex pattern (typically hydrogen atoms).*
  
  ```gsl
  resname r'^.*PC'
  ```

  *Selects all residues with names ending in "PC".*
  
  ```gsl
  group r'^P'
  ```

  *Selects all groups with names starting with 'P'.*

### Combining regular expressions with other identifiers

You can mix regex-based identifiers with standard identifiers in a single query.

- **Examples:**
  
  ```gsl
  name r'^C.*' and resname ALA GLY
  ```

  *Selects atoms with names starting with 'C' in residues named ALA or GLY.*

  ```gsl
  name P r'^[1-9]?H.*'
  ```
  
  *Selects atoms named 'P' and hydrogen atoms.*

### Syntax rules

- **Enclosure:**  
  The regex pattern must be enclosed within a "regular expression block" starting with `r'` and ending with `'`.

- **Case sensitivity:**  
  Regex patterns are case-sensitive unless specified otherwise within the pattern.

### Supported regex features

GSL uses the `regex` crate for evaluating regular expressions. For detailed information on supported regex features, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/).

# Important notes

### Selecting Elements

- **Element assignment:**  
  Atoms in the system **are not** automatically assigned elements by `groan_rs` unless the elements are explicitly specified in the input structure file. *This is because elements may not always be meaningful, particularly in coarse-grained systems.*

- **Using `element` keywords:**  
  To use `element name` or `element symbol` in your selections, ensure that atoms have been assigned elements.

- **Assigning elements:**
  - **From topology files:** Creating the `System` structure from a TPR file automatically assigns elements.
  - **Guessing elements:** Use the [`System::guess_elements`](https://docs.rs/groan_rs/latest/groan_rs/system/struct.System.html#method.guess_elements) function to assign elements based on atom names.

- **Recommendation:**  
  If you're using a program that utilizes GSL, ensure that it assigns elements to atoms before using `element` keywords in selections.

### Whitespace considerations

- **Operator and parenthesis separation:**  
  Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`, etc.) and parentheses do **not** need to be separated by whitespace unless it affects query clarity.

- **Valid example:**
  
  ```gsl
  not(name CA)or(serial 1to45||Protein)
  ```
  
  *A valid query without (unnecessary) whitespace.*

- **Invalid example:**
  
  ```gsl
  not(name CA)or(serial 1to45orProtein)
  ```
  
  *Invalid because `orProtein` is unclear.*

- **Resolving ambiguity:**
  
  Enclose ambiguous parts in parentheses to clarify intent. **Or use whitespace, it is worth it.**
  
  ```gsl
  not(name CA)or(serial 1to45or(Protein))
  ```
  
  *Now, the query is valid and interpretable, but not very human-readable.*
# Online GSL validator

You can easily verify the validity of your GSL query using the [online validation tool](https://ladme.github.io/gsl-validator/).

> **Note:** This tool checks only the general syntax of the query. It does not account for the specific context of your molecular system. Queries that reference non-existent groups in your system will still be considered valid syntactically but will fail during execution. The tool focuses solely on syntactical correctness and cannot interpret your intent. For example, the query `resname POPC name P` is syntactically valid but will probably not achieve the desired outcome.# Feedback and disclaimer
