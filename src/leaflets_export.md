# Exporting lipid assignment data

You can configure `gorder` to export leaflet assignment data into an external file. This can be useful for verifying leaflet assignments, reusing them for additional analyses, or ensuring reproducibility.

To export the lipid assignment data, add the `export` keyword to the `leaflets` section of your configuration file and specify the path to the output file:

```yaml
leaflets: !Global
  membrane: "@membrane"
  heads: "name P"
  frequency: !Every 5
  export: "leaflet_assignment.yaml"  # or collect: "leaflet_assignment.yaml"
```

*Alternatively, you can use the `collect` keyword instead of `export`.*

Leaflet classification will be performed using the [global](leaflets.md#global-method) method for every 5th analyzed frame (`frequency: !Every 5`). Once the trajectory has been processed, the assignment data will be written to `leaflet_assignment.yaml`. The data are exported in a condensed [leaflet assignment file](leaflets_assignment_file.md#leaflet-assignment-file) format. This means that you can directly reuse the exported YAML file in a subsequent `gorder` run by requesting manual leaflet classification. Since the output file is a valid YAML, you an also easily process it using other software.

> Note that exporting lipid assignment data is only supported for [automatic leaflet classification methods](leaflets.md): global, local, individual, spherical clustering, and clustering. Exporting lipid assignments is not supported for manual lipid assignment, as it is effectively pointless.

Below is an example of an exported leaflet assignment file for a very short trajectory:

Data are written separately for each molecule type. Within each block, every line beginning with `-` corresponds to a single trajectory frame for which leaflet classification was performed.  

Each number in the line represents the leaflet assignment of an individual lipid molecule of the specified type in the given trajectory frame:  

- `1` indicates the **Upper** leaflet  
- `0` indicates the **Lower** leaflet  

Molecules are listed in the order in which their **first atom** appears in the input structure file.

Note that the *frame index* refers to the sequential index of a frame in the input trajectory file, with the first **analyzed** frame assigned index 1. If your analysis begins later in the trajectory (using the [`begin`](timerange.md) keyword), frame 1 will **not** correspond to the very first frame of the trajectory.
